  - `consolidation_project/scripts/padic/alpha_p_computation.py` - Padic computations
  - Various LaTeX manipulation scripts in `consolidation_project/scripts/`

## LaTeX Conventions

### Document Structure
- Use `\documentclass` to indicate root LaTeX files
- Organize content hierarchically: main document ‚Üí sections ‚Üí subsections
- Keep appendices separate in dedicated files
- Use consistent naming: `ubt_*` for UBT content, `ctc_*` for CCT content

### Mathematical Notation
- **Biquaternions**: Complex-valued quaternions, use appropriate notation
- **Complex Time**: œÑ = t + iœà (t = real time, œà = imaginary/phase component)
- **Field Equations**: Follow standard tensor notation with clear index conventions
- **Gauge Groups**: SU(3) √ó SU(2) √ó U(1) for Standard Model symmetries

### Compilation Process
```bash
# Manual compilation (from project root or specific directory):
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode <file>.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode <file>.tex  # Run twice for references

# With bibliography:
pdflatex <file>.tex
bibtex <file>
pdflatex <file>.tex
pdflatex <file>.tex

# Using Makefile:
make core    # Compile core document
make all     # Compile all main documents
make clean   # Remove auxiliary files
```

### Automated Builds
- GitHub Actions automatically compiles all LaTeX root files on push/PR
- Workflow detects engine requirements (xelatex, lualatex) automatically
- Compiled PDFs are uploaded as artifacts and committed to `docs/pdfs/`

## Python Script Guidelines

### Style
- Use clear, descriptive variable names reflecting mathematical concepts
- Document complex mathematical operations with inline comments
- Include docstrings explaining the theoretical basis of computations

### Dependencies
- Prefer standard libraries (math, numpy, scipy) when possible
- Document any specialized physics/mathematics libraries used
- No formal dependency management - list requirements in comments

### Numerical Precision
- Be mindful of floating-point precision in theoretical calculations
- Use appropriate numerical methods for stability
- Validate results against known theoretical limits

## Research Domain Context

### Theoretical Physics
- **General Relativity**: Metric tensor derivations, curved spacetime
- **Quantum Field Theory**: Field quantization, gauge invariance
- **Standard Model**: SU(3) √ó SU(2) √ó U(1) gauge symmetries
- **Dark Sector**: Dark matter and dark energy via padic extensions

### UBT and General Relativity Compatibility

**Critical Theoretical Position**: The Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) **generalizes and embeds** Einstein's General Relativity‚Äîit does not contradict or replace it. This is a fundamental aspect of the theory that must be preserved in all documentation and code comments.

Key principles:
- **GR is fully contained within UBT**: In the real-valued limit (when imaginary time component œà ‚Üí 0), UBT exactly reproduces Einstein's field equations
- **All curvature regimes**: This compatibility holds for flat spacetime (Minkowski), weak fields, strong fields (black holes, neutron stars), and cosmological solutions with R ‚â† 0
- **Extended structure**: UBT introduces additional biquaternionic degrees of freedom representing phase curvature and nonlocal energy configurations
- **Invisibility**: These imaginary components remain invisible to classical observations because ordinary matter couples only to the real metric g_ŒºŒΩ
- **Experimental validation**: All confirmations of GR (perihelion precession, gravitational waves, etc.) automatically validate UBT's real sector

Language guidelines:
- ‚úÖ Use: "UBT generalizes GR", "UBT embeds GR", "UBT extends GR", "recovers Einstein's equations"
- ‚ùå Avoid: "alternative to GR", "replacement of GR", "contradiction with GR"
- When discussing invisibility or phase curvature, clarify these arise from imaginary components of the biquaternionic metric

Mathematical statement: The core field equation ‚àá‚Ä†‚àáŒò(q,œÑ) = Œ∫ùíØ(q,œÑ) reduces to R_ŒºŒΩ - ¬Ωg_ŒºŒΩ R = 8œÄG T_ŒºŒΩ in the real limit.

See appendix_R_GR_equivalence.tex for detailed derivation.

### Novel Concepts
- **Biquaternions**: Mathematical framework combining quaternions with complex coefficients
- **Complex Time**: Extension of real time to complex plane
- **Psychons**: Quantum excitations of consciousness fields
- **Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)**: Time-travel solutions in UBT metric
- **Theta Resonator**: Proposed experimental device for consciousness detection

### Mathematical Rigor
- Maintain consistency with established physics notation
- Clearly state assumptions and approximations
- Provide derivations for non-obvious results
- Reference standard texts where applicable

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming
- Use descriptive names: `feature/<feature-name>`, `fix/<issue-description>`
- Keep branches focused on specific tasks

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits format when appropriate
- Be descriptive: explain what changed and why
- For LaTeX: mention document/section being modified

## Key Concepts

- **UBT**: Unified Biquaternion Theory - the main theoretical framework
- **CCT**: Complex Consciousness Theory - simplified application of UBT for consciousness modeling
- **Complex time**: œÑ = t + iœà where œà is the imaginary time component
- **Biquaternions**: Mathematical foundation combining quaternions with complex coefficients
- **Psychons**: Quantum excitations of consciousness within complex-time phase space
- **CTCs**: Closed Timelike Curves - geometric solutions for time-travel
- **p-adic extensions**: Mathematical framework for dark matter and dark energy

## Build and Compilation

### LaTeX Compilation

The repository uses **pdflatex** for compiling LaTeX documents. Multiple compilation passes are needed for references.

**Local compilation:**
```bash
cd consolidation_project
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode ubt_2_main.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode ubt_2_main.tex
```

**Using Make:**
```bash
cd consolidation_project
make all     # Compile full document (ubt_2_main.tex)
make core    # Compile core document (ubt_core_main.tex)
make clean   # Remove auxiliary files
```

**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automatically compiles all root LaTeX files on push/PR. The workflow:
1. Discovers all `.tex` files with `\documentclass`
2. Detects the appropriate LaTeX engine (pdflatex/xelatex/lualatex)
3. Compiles each document
4. Uploads PDFs to `docs/pdfs/`

### Python Scripts

Python scripts are located in:
- `consolidation_project/scripts/` - Utility scripts for document processing
- `unified_biquaternion_theory/solution_*/` - Research calculations

No specific Python environment is required. Scripts are standalone utilities.

## Coding Style and Conventions

### LaTeX

- Use `\documentclass{article}` or similar for root documents
- Place appendices in separate files with descriptive names like `appendix_A_*.tex`
- Use consistent mathematical notation:
  - `\tau` for complex time
  - `\psi` for imaginary time component
  - Biquaternion fields denoted with bold symbols
- Include proper comments for complex derivations
- Use `\label` and `\ref` for cross-references
- Keep line lengths reasonable for version control

### Python

- Scripts are utility-focused, not production code
- Use clear variable names
- Include docstrings for non-trivial functions
- No strict style guide, but readability is important
