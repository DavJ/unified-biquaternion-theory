UBT Experimental Channel Selection Framework

This package contains experimental/analytical tools for exploring selection
mechanisms for prime number modes (especially 137, 139) without modifying
the core UBT theory.

All work here is isolated from core theoretical files and represents pure
exploratory validation with measurable, testable mathematics.
