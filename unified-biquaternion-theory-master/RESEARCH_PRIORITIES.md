## Lower Priority (Future Work)

### Consciousness Applications (Speculative)
- **Status:** Properly isolated in `speculative_extensions/`
- **Priority:** Low - separated from core physics
- **Note:** Requires neuroscience collaboration for meaningful progress

### Experimental Proposals
- **Theta Resonator:** Requires consciousness framework development
- **Modified gravity tests:** Effects too small (~10⁻⁶⁸)
- **CTC stability:** Theoretical interest only

### Community Building
- Conference presentations (2026-2027)
- External collaborations
- Independent verification
