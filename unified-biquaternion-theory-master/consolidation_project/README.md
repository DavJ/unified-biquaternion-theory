# 📄 Consolidation Project — Unified Biquaternion Theory

**Note:** This directory does **not** contain the original UBT documents in their full form.  
It is an **ongoing effort** to create a more compact, structured, and readable presentation of the Unified Biquaternion Theory.

Because the UBT framework is extensive and technically complex, this consolidation process is a **long-term task**.  
The content here will be gradually updated with improved formatting, clearer explanations, and integrated derivations.

⚠️ **Important:**  
- At this stage, some sections, proofs, and derivations are still **missing** or **incomplete**.  
- Until this consolidation is finished (and possibly even afterwards), the **`universal_biquaternion_theory`** directory remains the **primary and authoritative source** for the complete UBT documentation.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Consolidation
- **Clarity:** Present the UBT concepts in a more accessible and logically structured way.
- **Compactness:** Remove redundancy while keeping all essential derivations.
- **Integration:** Combine results scattered across multiple documents into a coherent whole.
- **Readability:** Improve typography, diagrams, and section flow.

## 📌 Current Status
- **In progress** — Core sections are being rewritten and re-structured.
- Appendices and experimental concepts are being merged gradually.
- Full validation against the original UBT sources is ongoing.

### Main Documents
- **[ubt_osf_publication.tex](MAIN_DOCUMENTS_GUIDE.md#ubt_osf_publicationtex--osf-ready-publication)** ⭐ — Clean, publication-ready document for OSF/journal submission
- **[ubt_core_main.tex](MAIN_DOCUMENTS_GUIDE.md#ubt_core_maintex---core-theory-only)** — Core theory without speculative content
- **[ubt_2_main.tex](MAIN_DOCUMENTS_GUIDE.md#ubt_2_maintex---full-consolidated-document)** — Complete framework including speculative research

## New Appendices (Quarks & QCD scale)

- **Appendix QA — Quarks and CKM in UBT**: Discrete mode assignment for $(u,d,s,c,b,t)$, CKM from overlaps on $\mathbb{T}^2$, and ratio checks without tuning.
- **Appendix K.5 — $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ from geometry**: Two-loop link between $R^{-1}$ and $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ with discrete holonomy thresholds and scheme tracking.
