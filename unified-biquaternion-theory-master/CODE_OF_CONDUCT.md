# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing scientific understanding.

## Our Standards

* **Overstatement**: Claiming more certainty than evidence supports
* **Dogmatism**: Refusing to consider valid criticisms

## Scientific Discourse Standards

### What We Encourage

1. **Critical Analysis**
   - Question assumptions and derivations
   - Identify errors or gaps in reasoning
   - Propose alternative explanations
   - Request clarification when needed

2. **Evidence-Based Discussion**
   - Support claims with references or calculations
   - Distinguish between fact and speculation
   - Quantify uncertainties when possible
   - Update views based on new evidence

3. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**
   - Work together to resolve disagreements
   - Seek common ground and shared understanding
   - Combine complementary expertise
   - Build on others' contributions

4. **Honest Assessment**
   - Acknowledge when results are negative
   - Report null findings transparently
   - Admit when you don't know something
   - Correct mistakes publicly

### What We Discourage

1. **Argument from Authority**
   - "Trust me, I have a PhD" without evidence
   - Dismissing contributors without credentials
   - Ignoring valid criticism due to source

2. **Motivated Reasoning**
   - Defending claims despite contradicting evidence
   - Selectively citing only supporting references
   - Moving goalposts when predictions fail
   - Refusing to acknowledge limitations

3. **Weaponized Skepticism**
   - Demanding impossible standards of proof
   - Nitpicking minor issues while ignoring substance
   - Using skepticism selectively to defend preferred views
   - Bad faith "just asking questions"

4. **Dogmatic Positions**
   - Treating UBT as unquestionable truth
   - Refusing to consider that UBT might be wrong
   - Dismissing competing theories without analysis
   - Ignoring established physics without justification

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Repository maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Related communication channels
- Public representation of the project
- Scientific conferences or events where UBT is discussed

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the repository maintainers at [contact information in README].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional behavior.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression toward individuals or groups.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Scientific Integrity Specific Guidelines

### For Contributors

**When Contributing:**
- Clearly label speculation vs. established results (see SPECULATIVE_VS_EMPIRICAL.md)
- Cite sources appropriately
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Provide sufficient detail for reproducibility
- Don't overstate confidence in results

**When Reviewing:**
- Focus on technical content, not personal characteristics
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Distinguish between errors and differences of approach
- Acknowledge good work even when offering criticism

**When Discussing:**
- Assume good faith unless proven otherwise
- Ask clarifying questions before criticizing
- Distinguish "this is wrong" from "I don't understand"

- Update community on enforcement actions (respecting privacy)
- Admit when you make mistakes as maintainer

## Attribution
