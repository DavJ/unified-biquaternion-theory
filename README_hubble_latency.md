## Hubble Tension as Information-Theoretic Overhead (Research Hypothesis)

**🔵 RESEARCH FRONT**: Testable hypothesis under investigation

UBT explores whether the Hubble tension could arise from information-processing
overhead inherent to maintaining global coherence in a finite-capacity system.

### Framework
- Information constraint from GF(2⁸) field structure
- Effective overhead in time evolution: O ≈ 16–21 per 256 units
- Overhead fraction: δ ≈ 0.08
- Predicted relation: H₀_local ≈ H₀_global / (1 − δ)

### Interpretation
This treats information limits as fundamental physical constraints (similar to
Bekenstein bound or holographic principle), **not** as evidence of simulated reality.

### Status
- Mathematical framework: Established
- Observational validation: Pending
- Falsifiable predictions: Identified

See `appendix_hubble_latency.md` for detailed analysis and `calibrate_hubble_latency.py` for calculations.

**Note**: This hypothesis may be validated, constrained, or falsified by future observations.
It is not required for core UBT validity.
