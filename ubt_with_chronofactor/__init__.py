UBT with Chronofactor formulation.

This directory contains the chronofactor-based formulation of Unified
Biquaternion Theory (UBT), where complex time τ = t + iψ is used as an
external evolution parameter.

This is a first-class formulation maintained for systematic A/B comparison
with the chronofactor-free formulation.
