## ⚠️ DO NOT FILL THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE CONFIRMATORY SUCCESS

This document is for **interpretation ONLY after court-grade confirmation**.

**Rules**:
1. Do NOT interpret exploratory results
2. Do NOT write this document until:
   - Confirmatory test shows PASS (p < threshold)
   - Signal replicates in ≥2 independent datasets
   - All robustness checks completed
3. Keep UBT assumptions SEPARATE from detection code
4. Be explicit about theoretical assumptions

## Template Structure

### 1. Confirmed Signal Summary

**Fill this section ONLY after confirmatory PASS**

- **Observable**: [e.g., CMB map-level phases]
- **Statistic**: [e.g., R(P) phase coherence]
- **Best period**: Δℓ = [value]
- **p-value (primary dataset)**: [value]
- **p-value (replication dataset)**: [value]
- **R(P) observed**: [value]
- **R(P) expected under null**: [value]
- **Significance**: [σ level]

### 2. Replication Status

**Fill this section ONLY after replication campaign**

| Dataset | Observable | R(P) | p-value | Verdict |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|---------|
| [Primary] | [e.g., T-mode alm] | [value] | [value] | PASS/NULL |
| [Replication 1] | [e.g., E-mode alm] | [value] | [value] | PASS/NULL |
| [Replication 2] | [e.g., SMICA T-mode] | [value] | [value] | PASS/NULL |

**Overall replication verdict**: [CONSISTENT / INCONSISTENT]

If INCONSISTENT → Report NULL, do not interpret.

### 3. Theoretical Context (UBT Assumptions)

**Clearly label assumptions**:

#### Assumption 1: Discrete Architecture
- UBT posits that spacetime may have discrete/lattice structure at Planck scale
- This could manifest as periodic relationships in observables
- **Prediction**: Phase-locking at specific periods related to fundamental constants

#### Assumption 2: Complex Time
- UBT introduces complex time τ = t + iψ
- Phase information may encode structure invisible to amplitude measurements
- **Prediction**: Map-level phases show coherence, power spectra do not

#### Assumption 3: [Add others as needed]

**IMPORTANT**: These are UBT-specific interpretations. The confirmed signal is an **empirical finding** independent of UBT theory.

### 4. Alternative Explanations

**Consider non-UBT explanations**:

1. **Systematic artifacts**:
   - Instrumental effects
   - Data processing artifacts
   - Component separation residuals

2. **Known astrophysical sources**:
   - Foreground contamination
   - Galactic emission patterns
   - Point source masking effects

3. **Statistical fluctuations**:
   - Even with p < threshold, false positives possible
   - Multiple independent datasets reduce this risk

4. **Other theoretical frameworks**:
   - Discrete spacetime models
   - Lattice quantum gravity
   - Causal set theory
   - Loop quantum cosmology

**Conclusion on alternatives**: [Assess likelihood of each]

### 5. Predicted Relationships

**If signal is real and UBT-related, predict**:

- **Period relationship to α**: [e.g., Δℓ ≈ f(α⁻¹)]
- **Phase structure**: [expected coherence pattern]
- **Cross-correlations**: [other observables that should show signal]

**Testable predictions for future work**:
1. [Prediction 1]
2. [Prediction 2]
3. [Prediction 3]

### 6. Implications if Confirmed

**If signal is robust and UBT interpretation correct**:

#### For Fundamental Physics
- Evidence for discrete spacetime structure
- New constraint on Planck-scale physics
- Potential window into quantum gravity

#### For Cosmology
- Modify inflationary predictions
- Impact on primordial power spectrum interpretation
- Constraints on early universe models

#### For UBT Specifically
- [Specific UBT predictions validated]
- [Parameter constraints]
- [Next-level tests enabled]

### 7. Next Experimental Targets

**Based on this signal, prioritize**:

1. **High Priority**:
   - [Observable 1]
   - [Observable 2]

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - [Observable 3]
   - [Observable 4]

3. **Laboratory Tests**:
   - [Near-field experiment 1]
   - [Interferometry test 2]

### 8. Publication Strategy

**Recommended approach**:

1. **Empirical paper** (no UBT interpretation):
   - Title: "Periodic Phase Coherence in CMB Spherical Harmonics"
   - Focus: Robust empirical detection
   - Minimal theoretical speculation

2. **Interpretation paper** (UBT framework):
   - Title: "Discrete Architecture Fingerprint: UBT Interpretation"
   - Clearly label as theoretical interpretation
   - Connect to broader UBT predictions

**Co-authorship**: Include independent replicators

### 9. Caveats and Limitations

**Honest assessment of uncertainties**:

- Possible systematic we didn't consider
- Limited replication (only N datasets)
- Alternative periods not fully explored
- Theoretical interpretation not unique

### 10. References

**Data sources**:
- [Planck 2018 PR3]
- [WMAP 9yr]
- [etc.]

**Theoretical background**:
- UBT main papers
- Discrete spacetime literature
- Quantum gravity references

## Reminder: Only Fill After Confirmation

This document remains empty until:
- ✅ Confirmatory test PASS
- ✅ Replication successful
