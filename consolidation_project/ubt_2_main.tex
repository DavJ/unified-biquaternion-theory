\section*{CORE Scope and Claims}
This CORE manuscript presents a biquaternion formulation that \textbf{generalizes and embeds Einstein's General Relativity} while recovering the Einstein--Maxwell--Dirac system under a standard variational action. The theory demonstrates the correct limits (Minkowski and weak-field), and \textbf{in the real-valued limit, exactly reproduces Einstein's field equations} for all curvature regimes, including cases where the Ricci scalar $R \neq 0$.

UBT extends GR by introducing biquaternionic degrees of freedom that represent phase-like and nonlocal components of spacetime. These additional components remain invisible to classical observations but may be relevant for dark sector physics and quantum gravitational corrections. \textbf{We do not claim an ab-initio derivation of the fine-structure constant}~$\alpha$; in the CORE track $\alpha(\mu)$ is treated as an empirical input consistent with QED running. Any links between the auxiliary phase coordinate~$\psi$ and consciousness are considered \emph{interpretive and speculative} and are not part of the CORE results. Quantitative, testable predictions are stated with their assumptions and orders of magnitude.
