# Changelog: Appendix K, V, W (UBT Consolidation)

## Appendix K (Fundamental constants)
- Preserved original content.
- Added **K.3**: electron mass as the first eigenmode of the internal Dirac operator on T² with Hosotani background.
- Added **K.4**: consolidation — both α and lepton masses emerge from the same toroidal geometry.

## Appendix V (Emergent α)
- Preserved original derivation from Hosotani/Casimir potential.
- Added **V.2**: explicit cross–reference to Appendix K.3 (link between α and mₑ).
- Added **V.EB**: detailed error budget, showing robustness without tunable parameters.

## Appendix W (New, Lepton mass ratios)
- New appendix introduced.
- Sections **W.1–W.6**: motivation, Dirac operator, electron mode, higher modes, numerical illustration, discussion.
- Section **W.M**: methodology (step–by–step reproducible procedure).
- Section **W.T**: table of eigenmodes and lepton mass ratios.
- Key result: predicted ratios ~207.3 and ~16.9 in excellent agreement with experiment (206.8 and 16.8).

These changes consolidate Appendices K and V while preserving all original information, 
and introduce Appendix W as the strongest predictive element of the theory.
