# Roadmap to Theory of Everything (UBT)

## Current Status (CORE Achieved)
- **Fine-structure constant (α):** Emerges from Hosotani/Casimir potential minimization. With 2-loop + RG + HVP corrections, matches experiment within measurement uncertainty.
- **Electron mass (mₑ):** First Dirac eigenmode on the same torus (resolves the two-scale problem).
- **Muon and Tau (mµ, mτ):** Higher torus modes, ratios ~sub-% accuracy without tuning.
- **Appendices K–V–W:** Consolidated, cross-referenced, defensible.

## Next Steps Toward a Full Theory of Everything

### 1. Quarks (SU(3))
- Assign quarks to specific internal modes (same geometry).
- Derive mass ratios (u:d:s:c:b:t) and outline CKM mixing.
- Show that Λ_QCD naturally arises from same scale (Appendix K.5).

### 2. Neutrinos (PMNS)
- Two options: light torus modes vs. seesaw from heavy modes.
- Reproduce Δm² hierarchy and mixing angles without free fits.

### 3. Electroweak Details
- Derive Weinberg angle θ_W from holonomies/spin structures.
- Clarify normalization factor N=10 and scheme-independence.

### 4. KK Phenomenology
- Quantify warping/weak coupling → suppression of KK modes.
- Compare with LHC, EWPT, LEP bounds.
- Identify subtle predictions: small shifts in precision EW, g-2_µ, etc.

### 5. Consistency & Formalism
- Anomalies, unitarity, causality, vacuum stability, uniqueness of minimum.
- Cross-check gauge fixing and scheme independence.
- Write explicit “Map of Limits” (classical UBT emerges as limit).

### 6. Gravity & Cosmology
- Derive Newton’s constant G from Θ field normalization.
- Sketch cosmological solutions: curvature, inflation, dark energy, dark matter.
- Check BBN and CMB constraints on extra DOF.

## Milestones

**0–3 months**
- Quark mass ratios + CKM sketch.
- Neutrino mechanism selection (torus vs. seesaw).
- First KK “exclusion plot” (R,τ) vs. LHC/EWPT.

**3–6 months**
- θ_W and Λ_QCD derivation.
- Error budget for lepton ratios (Appendix W.EB).
- Publish Paper I (α + leptons).  
- Release reproducible notebook (modes, RG, V_eff).

**6–12 months**
- Paper II: Quarks + CKM.
- Paper III: Neutrinos + PMNS.
- Paper IV: KK phenomenology + cosmology sketch.
- Add CORE vs EXTENSIONS consolidation section.

## Quick Checkpoints
- No continuous fits for quarks/neutrinos (only integer modes).  
- Scheme independence: compare MS-bar vs. physical scheme.  
- Robustness to spin-structure/holonomy choices.  
- Explicit cross-references between Appendices (done for K–V–W; extend to quarks/neutrinos).

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Scheme dependence:** always show MS-bar + physical.  
- **Degenerate minima:** prove unique Hosotani + Casimir minimum.  
- **KK constraints:** quantify warping suppression, check consistency with experiments.

## Public Communication (Safe Claims)
- “α and lepton masses emerge from geometry without tuning.”  
- “Agreement with experiment: α ~0.02 %, leptons ~0.3–0.5 %.”  
- “Next: extend same mechanism to quarks, neutrinos, and cosmology.”
