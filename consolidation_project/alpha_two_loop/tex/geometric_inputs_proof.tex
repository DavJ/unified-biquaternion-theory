\section{Geometric Inputs \(N_{\mathrm{eff}}\) and \(R_\psi\)}
\label{sec:geom-inputs}
We formalize the mode-counting \(N_{\mathrm{eff}}\) and the geometric normalization \(R_\psi\)
as follows: (i) define the spectral domain and boundary conditions on the Hermitian slice
(Appendix~P6); (ii) prove that \(N_{\mathrm{eff}}\) equals the stated value under these
constraints; (iii) show that \(R_\psi\) is fixed (not chosen) by the normalization that
matches the Thomson limit in the QED reduction. This eliminates ad-hoc freedom.
