**Two-Loop Derivation TODOs**
- [ ] Define analytic continuation τ = t + iψ and allowed domains for propagators.
- [ ] Specify contour deformations; prove reduction to real-time QED as ψ→0.
- [ ] Enumerate two-loop topologies (sunset, double-bubble, vertex, nested self-energy, counterterms).
- [ ] Generate diagrams (tool of choice) and label them consistently.
- [ ] IBP reduction to master integrals; document chosen basis.
- [ ] Compute Z3 at two loops; enforce Ward–Takahashi (Z1 = Z2).
- [ ] Extract c2(μ); provide intermediate invariants for review.
- [ ] QED-limit validation: reproduce universal β(α) to two loops.

# Complex Time Prescription for Two-Loop Calculations

This document details the analytic continuation and prescription for handling propagators in complex time τ = t + iψ for two-loop computations of R_UBT(μ).

## Analytic Continuation

The complex time variable is defined as:
```
τ = t + iψ
```
where:
- t is the standard real time coordinate
- ψ is the imaginary time component related to the phase structure

## Allowed Domains for Propagators

(To be defined based on convergence requirements and physical boundary conditions)

## Contour Deformations

(To be specified)

## Reduction to Real-Time QED

The limit ψ → 0 should recover standard QED results. This provides a crucial consistency check.

## Additional Notes

This is a working document for tracking the two-loop derivation progress.
