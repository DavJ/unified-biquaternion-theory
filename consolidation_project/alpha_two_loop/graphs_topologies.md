**Two-Loop Derivation TODOs**
- [ ] Define analytic continuation τ = t + iψ and allowed domains for propagators.
- [ ] Specify contour deformations; prove reduction to real-time QED as ψ→0.
- [ ] Enumerate two-loop topologies (sunset, double-bubble, vertex, nested self-energy, counterterms).
- [ ] Generate diagrams (tool of choice) and label them consistently.
- [ ] IBP reduction to master integrals; document chosen basis.
- [ ] Compute Z3 at two loops; enforce Ward–Takahashi (Z1 = Z2).
- [ ] Extract c2(μ); provide intermediate invariants for review.
- [ ] QED-limit validation: reproduce universal β(α) to two loops.

# Graph Topologies for Two-Loop R_UBT Computation

This document catalogs the Feynman diagram topologies required for the two-loop computation of the renormalization factor R_UBT(μ).

## Two-Loop Topologies

### 1. Sunset Diagrams
- Photon self-energy with fermion loop insertion
- (Details to be added)

### 2. Double-Bubble
- Two disjoint fermion bubbles connected by photon lines
- (Details to be added)

### 3. Vertex Corrections
- Two-loop vertex corrections preserving Ward identity
- (Details to be added)

### 4. Nested Self-Energy
- Nested corrections contributing via counterterms
- (Details to be added)

### 5. Counterterms
- Required counterterm diagrams
- (Details to be added)

## Diagram Generation

(Tool selection and labeling conventions to be specified)

## Master Integral Basis

(IBP reduction strategy to be documented)

## Ward–Takahashi Identity Enforcement

The computation must enforce Z1 = Z2 at two loops to maintain gauge invariance.

## Additional Notes

This is a working document for tracking graph topology enumeration and reduction.
