\begin{abstract}
The Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) presents a unified framework combining General Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, and Standard Model symmetries within a biquaternionic field defined over biquaternionic time $\tau = t + i\psi$. This theory generalizes Einstein's General Relativity and, in the real-valued limit, exactly reproduces Einstein's field equations for all curvature regimes. UBT extends the framework through additional biquaternionic degrees of freedom that may correspond to dark sector physics and quantum gravitational corrections.

\section{Introduction}

The Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding fundamental physics by embedding General Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, and the Standard Model within a single mathematical structure based on biquaternionic fields over biquaternionic time.

The core equation of UBT is:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^\dagger\nabla\Theta(q,\tau) = \kappa \mathcal{T}(q,\tau)
\end{equation}
where $\Theta(q,\tau)$ is the unified biquaternionic field, $q \in \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}$ represents biquaternion coordinates, $\tau = t + i\psi$ is biquaternionic time, $\nabla^\dagger\nabla$ is the gauge-covariant d'Alembertian, $\kappa$ is the coupling constant related to $8\pi G$, and $\mathcal{T}$ is the energy-momentum tensor.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

\subsection{Biquaternionic Structure}

The biquaternion algebra $\mathbb{B} = \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}$ combines complex numbers with quaternions, providing a rich algebraic structure capable of encoding both spacetime geometry and internal gauge symmetries.

\subsection{Complex Time}

Complex time $\tau = t + i\psi$ extends the real time coordinate $t$ by adding an imaginary component $\psi$ that represents phase-like degrees of freedom. This extension enables the unified treatment of quantum phases and gravitational curvature within a single geometric framework.

\section{Physical Content}

\subsection{General Relativity Recovery}

In the real-valued limit, UBT exactly reproduces Einstein's field equations:
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
This ensures full compatibility with all experimental confirmations of General Relativity, including perihelion precession, gravitational waves, and cosmological solutions.

\subsection{Standard Model Symmetries}

The gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ of the Standard Model emerges naturally from the automorphism group of the biquaternionic structure, providing a geometric origin for the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.

\subsection{Dark Sector Physics}

The additional degrees of freedom in the biquaternionic field, beyond those required for reproducing General Relativity, may provide candidates for dark matter and dark energy phenomena through p-adic extensions of the theory.
