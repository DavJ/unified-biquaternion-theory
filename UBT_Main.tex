\begin{abstract}
The Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) presents a unified framework combining General Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, and Standard Model symmetries within a biquaternionic field defined over complex time $\tau = t + i\psi$. This theory generalizes Einstein's General Relativity and, in the real-valued limit, exactly reproduces Einstein's field equations for all curvature regimes. UBT extends the framework through additional biquaternionic degrees of freedom that may correspond to dark sector physics and quantum gravitational corrections.

\section{Introduction}

The Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding fundamental physics by embedding General Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, and the Standard Model within a single mathematical structure based on biquaternionic fields over complex time.

The core equation of UBT is:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^\dagger\nabla\Theta(q,\tau) = \kappa \mathcal{T}(q,\tau)
\end{equation}
where $\Theta(q,\tau)$ is the unified biquaternionic field, $q \in \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}$ represents biquaternion coordinates, $\tau = t + i\psi$ is complex time, $\nabla^\dagger\nabla$ is the gauge-covariant d'Alembertian, $\kappa$ is the coupling constant related to $8\pi G$, and $\mathcal{T}$ is the energy-momentum tensor.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

\subsection{Biquaternionic Structure}

The biquaternion algebra $\mathbb{B} = \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}$ combines complex numbers with quaternions, providing a rich algebraic structure capable of encoding both spacetime geometry and internal gauge symmetries.

\subsection{Complex Time}

Complex time $\tau = t + i\psi$ extends the real time coordinate $t$ by adding an imaginary component $\psi$ that represents phase-like degrees of freedom. This extension enables the unified treatment of quantum phases and gravitational curvature within a single geometric framework.

\subsection{Biquaternionic Metric and Projection}

The fundamental geometry is encoded in the biquaternionic metric $\mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu}(\Theta)$ built from the field $\Theta$. All curvature tensors $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}$ and connections are derived from $\mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu}$. The classical metric is a projection
\[
g_{\mu\nu} \;:=\; \Re\!\left(\mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu}\right),
\qquad
R_{\mu\nu} \;:=\; \Re\!\left(\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}\right),
\qquad
T_{\mu\nu} \;:=\; \Re\!\left(\mathcal{T}_{\mu\nu}\right),
\]
used only to describe the Hermitian (real) sector.

\section{Physical Content}

\subsection{General Relativity Recovery}

In the Hermitian (real) projection $\mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu}\mapsto g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}\mapsto R_{\mu\nu}$, UBT exactly reproduces Einstein's field equations:
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
This ensures full compatibility with all experimental confirmations of General Relativity, including perihelion precession, gravitational waves, and cosmological solutions.

\subsection{Why GR Misses Exotic Regimes}

Classical GR observes only $g_{\mu\nu}=\Re(\mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu})$, so any solution with $\Im(\mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu})\neq 0$ projects to the same real geometry and remains invisible. Antigravitational responses, metric cloaking, or temporal drift arise from these imaginary components and are suppressed in the projection. They are not forbidden by physics; they are hidden by the Hermitian reduction. UBT therefore extends GR without contradiction: the real sector matches Einsteinian dynamics, while the full biquaternionic geometry supports exotic but observationally hidden regimes.

\subsection{Standard Model Symmetries}

The gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ of the Standard Model emerges naturally from the automorphism group of the biquaternionic structure, providing a geometric origin for the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.

\subsection{Dark Sector Physics}

The additional degrees of freedom in the biquaternionic field, beyond those required for reproducing General Relativity, may provide candidates for dark matter and dark energy phenomena through p-adic extensions of the theory.
