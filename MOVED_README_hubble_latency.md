# ⚠️ CONTENT MOVED

**This file has been relocated as of January 2026.**

The Hubble Latency README has been moved to the **Research Front** layer.

**New Location:** [research_front/hubble_latency/README.md](research_front/hubble_latency/README.md)

**Why?** The Hubble Latency hypothesis is an exploratory research hypothesis (Layer C), not part of Core UBT.

**Full content now at:**
- [research_front/hubble_latency/README.md](research_front/hubble_latency/README.md) - Overview and quick start
- [research_front/hubble_latency/HYPOTHESIS.md](research_front/hubble_latency/HYPOTHESIS.md) - Complete hypothesis statement
- [research_front/hubble_latency/model/](research_front/hubble_latency/model/) - Mathematical model
- [research_front/hubble_latency/calibration/](research_front/hubble_latency/calibration/) - Calibration scripts
