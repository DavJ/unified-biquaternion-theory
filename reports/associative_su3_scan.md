# Track A: Associative SU(3) Scan — Results

**Status:** Computational analysis complete (algebraic/structural scan).

## 1. Dimension Analysis

| Algebra | Real dim | Rank (ℂ) |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| gl(2,ℂ) | 8 | 2 |
| gl(2,ℂ)⊕gl(2,ℂ) = Lie(Aut(ℂ⊗ℍ)) | 16 | 4 |
| su(3) | 8 | 2 |

## 2. su(3) Algebra Closure Verification

- Closure residual: `0.00e+00`
- su(3) closes correctly: `True`

## 3. Can su(3) Embed in gl(2,ℂ)?

- **Result:** `False`
- Reason: sl(2,ℂ) is a complex simple Lie algebra of complex rank 1 (maximal toral subalgebra dimension 1), with 1 positive root. su(3) has complex rank 2 with 3 positive roots. A simple Lie algebra cannot embed as a subalgebra of a Lie algebra with strictly smaller complex rank. Therefore su(3) ⊄ gl(2,ℂ).

## 4. Can su(3) Embed in Aut(ℂ⊗ℍ) = gl(2,ℂ)⊕gl(2,ℂ)?

- **Result:** `False`
- Reason: Since su(3) does not embed in either gl(2,ℂ) factor (rank obstruction), it cannot embed in gl(2,ℂ)⊕gl(2,ℂ) by product/diagonal construction either. This confirms that SU(3) cannot arise from Aut(ℂ⊗ℍ) alone.

## 5. Conclusion

**SU(3) cannot arise from the purely associative structure ℂ⊗ℍ alone.**

This structural analysis confirms that the associative automorphism group
Aut(ℂ⊗ℍ) ≅ [GL(2,ℂ)×GL(2,ℂ)]/ℤ₂ does not contain SU(3) as a subgroup.
A rank/root obstruction prevents any embedding of su(3) in gl(2,ℂ)⊕gl(2,ℂ).

**Implication for UBT:**
- SU(3) requires the octonionic extension ℂ⊗𝕆 (Track B).
- Track B remains a hypothesis until the necessity of the extension
  is proven (see `research_tracks/octonionic_completion/hypothesis.md`).

## 6. Caveats

- This scan uses structural/algebraic arguments. It does not rule out
  SU(3) appearing as a stabilizer of a tensor built from ℂ⊗ℍ data
  (sub-question 4 in strategy.md) — that case requires separate analysis.
- Non-standard embeddings (e.g., via real forms) are not exhaustively
  classified here.
