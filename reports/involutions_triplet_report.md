# Track A: Z2×Z2×Z2 Involution Triplet — Signature Report

**Status:** Candidate construction — Track A, conservative framing.

## 1. Basis and Involution Definitions

Algebra: **ℬ = ℂ⊗ℍ**, viewed as an 8-dimensional real vector space with basis

    B = {1, I, J, K, i, iI, iJ, iK}

where `i` is the complex imaginary unit and `I, J, K` are the quaternion units.

Three commuting real-linear involutions:

| Involution | Definition | Physical interpretation |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| **P1** | `i → −i`, I/J/K fixed | Complex conjugation |
| **P2** | `I,J,K → −I,−J,−K`, i fixed | Quaternion conjugation |
| **P3** | `I → I, J → −J, K → −K`, i fixed | Axis-flip around I |

## 2. Involution Verification

- P1² = id: **True**
- P2² = id: **True**
- P3² = id: **True**
- [P1, P2] = 0: **True**
- [P1, P3] = 0: **True**
- [P2, P3] = 0: **True**

## 3. Eigenvalue Signature Table

| Element | P1 (cpx conj) | P2 (quat conj) | P3 (axis-flip I) | Sector |
|---------|:-------------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|--------|
| 1     | + | + | + | (+,+,+) |
| I     | + | - | + | (+,-,+) |
| J     | + | - | - | (+,-,-) |
| K     | + | - | - | (+,-,-) |
| i     | - | + | + | (-,+,+) |
| iI    | - | - | + | (-,-,+) |
| iJ    | - | - | - | (-,-,-) |
| iK    | - | - | - | (-,-,-) |


## 4. Sector Cardinalities

| Sector | dim_ℝ | Basis elements |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| `(+,+,+)` | 1 | 1 |
| `(+,+,-)` | 0 | ∅ (empty) ← single-minus |
| `(+,-,+)` | 1 | I ← single-minus |
| `(+,-,-)` | 2 | J, K |
| `(-,+,+)` | 1 | i ← single-minus |
| `(-,+,-)` | 0 | ∅ (empty) |
| `(-,-,+)` | 1 | iI |
| `(-,-,-)` | 2 | iJ, iK |

## 5. Single-Minus Sectors

- **S1 = (−,+,+):** i — dim_ℝ = 1
- **S2 = (+,−,+):** I — dim_ℝ = 1
- **S3 = (+,+,−):** ∅ (empty) — dim_ℝ = 0

### Note on S3

The sector S3 = (+,+,−) is **empty** under the given involution definitions.
This is a mathematical consequence: any element with P1=+1 (no complex-i)
and P2=+1 (no quaternion-unit factor) is a real scalar multiple of 1,
and P3(1) = +1, so it lies in (+,+,+) rather than (+,+,−).
This is noted explicitly as part of the conservative candidate framing.

## 6. Candidate 3D Complex Carrier Space Vc

The natural **3D complex** carrier space is the P2=−1 eigenspace:

    Vc = span_ℂ{I, J, K}

Real basis of Vc: {I, J, K, iI, iJ, iK}  (dim_ℝ = 6, dim_ℂ = 3)

Within Vc, P3 acts as a ℂ-linear involution with eigenspaces:
- P3 = +1: span_ℂ{I}  (1D over ℂ)
- P3 = −1: span_ℂ{J, K}  (2D over ℂ)

The SU(3) **candidate** is the group of ℂ-linear unitary transformations
of determinant 1 acting on Vc ≅ ℂ³.

## 7. Conservative Framing

This construction identifies an SU(3) acting on a Θ-triplet subspace
extracted from ℬ via the P2 involution.  It is **not** claimed that
SU(3) arises as an automorphism of ℬ itself (the automorphism group
Aut(ℂ⊗ℍ) ≅ [GL(2,ℂ)×GL(2,ℂ)]/ℤ₂ does not contain SU(3) — see
`reports/associative_su3_scan.md`).  This is Track A, candidate
construction only.
