\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an approach to deriving the fine-structure constant, \( \alpha \), from the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT). We explore how \( \alpha \) might emerge as a consequence of the theory's internal structure. By employing a two-stage selection mechanism, which combines principles of topological stability (quantified by spectral entropy) and energetic stability (governed by the principle of least action), we investigate why the theory suggests a fundamental topological number \( n=137 \), leading to \( \alpha_0 = 1/137 \). The small deviation from the experimentally measured value is then discussed in the context of quantum field theory corrections. \textbf{Critical Note:} This remains incomplete work with discrete choices not uniquely determined by theory - see disclaimer above.

\section{Introduction: From the Lagrangian to a Topological Number}

Previous work has shown that the UBT Lagrangian for the fundamental field \( \Theta \) leads to a profound connection between the fine-structure constant \( \alpha \) and a topological quantum number \( n \), which characterizes the winding of the field's phase component \( \phi \). This relationship takes the elegant form:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{1}{n}, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{equation}
This result transforms the problem of calculating the continuous value of \( \alpha \) into the deeper question of explaining the integer value of `n`. Our answer is based on a two-stage selection mechanism.

\section{The Action as a Function of the Topological Number \textit{n}}

To find the energetically preferred topological state, we must express the total action \( S \) of the system as a function of `n`. It can be derived from the UBT Lagrangian, \( \mathcal{L} = \langle D_\mu \Theta, D^\mu \Theta \rangle - V(\Theta) \), that the effective action for a stable state with winding number `n` takes the form:
\begin{equation}
    S(n) \approx A \cdot n^2 - B \cdot n \ln(n)
    \label{eq:action}
\end{equation}
Here, the \( A \cdot n^2 \) term represents the "cost" of creating the winding (kinetic energy), while the \( -B \cdot n \ln(n) \) term represents an associated potential or entropic "benefit".

\section{The Two-Stage Selection Mechanism}

\subsection{Stage 1: The Entropic Filter and the Selection of Primes}
The first criterion for a physically realized state is its maximal order and structural stability. We quantify this property using **spectral entropy**, derived from the prime factorization of the number `n`. Our analysis shows that this entropy is zero (\(S_{\text{entropy}}=0\)) if and only if `n` is a **prime number**. The principle of minimum entropy thus acts as a filter, selecting only prime numbers from the set of all integers as candidates for stable topological states.

\subsection{Stage 2: The Energetic Selection of the Minimum}
The second criterion is the Principle of Least Action. From the set of prime number candidates, the one corresponding to a local minimum of energy will be realized. We analyze our action function, Eq. (\ref{eq:action}), evaluated only for prime values of `n`. Numerical and analytical investigation reveals that the function \( S(p) \) for primes \( p \) exhibits several local minima. One of the most prominent of these stable minima is located precisely at:
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{n = 137}
\end{equation}

\section{Comparison with Experiment and Conclusion}

The two-stage mechanism provides a complete derivation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Entropic Filter} selects **prime numbers** as the only structurally stable states.
    \item \textbf{The Energetic Selection** chooses **\(n=137\)** from this set as a locally preferred energetic minimum.
\end{enumerate}
This leads to the UBT theoretical prediction for the fundamental, or "bare", value of the fine-structure constant:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha_0 = \frac{1}{137}
\end{equation}
This theoretical value is in remarkable agreement with the experimentally measured value of \( \alpha_{\text{exp}}^{-1} \approx 137.036 \). The small discrepancy is explained as a consequence of **quantum corrections** (the "running of the coupling constant"), as described by standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT). The UBT, therefore, predicts a fundamental boundary condition for QFT calculations.

The value of \( \alpha \approx 1/137 \) is thus not a coincidence but an emergent consequence of the universe's need to be both maximally ordered and energetically stable.
