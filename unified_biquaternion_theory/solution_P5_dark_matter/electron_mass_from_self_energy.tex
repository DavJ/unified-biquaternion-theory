\section*{Overview}

In this document, we present a derivation of the electron mass as arising from its own electromagnetic self-energy, in line with the hypothesis of dual mass origin proposed in the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT).

\section*{1. Self-Energy of a Smeared Charge Distribution}

We start from the classical expression for the electrostatic self-energy:
\[
\delta m_e = \frac{1}{2} \int \rho(\vec{x}) \phi(\vec{x})\, d^3x
\]
Assuming a Gaussian charge distribution for the topological field configuration (Hopfion), we solve Poisson's equation and obtain the electrostatic potential. The resulting self-energy is:
\[
\delta m_e = \frac{e^2}{\sqrt{\pi} R}
\]
where \( R \) is the effective "size" of the charge distribution.

\section*{2. Total Energy of the Hopfion Field \(\Theta_1\)}

We consider the topological solution:
\[
\Theta_1(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{(1 + r^2)^2}
\]
Computing the total energy density of this configuration:
\[
T_{00}(\vec{x}) = |\nabla \Theta_1|^2
\]
we obtain the total energy:
\[
E = \frac{\pi^2}{2 R^3}
\]

\section*{3. Effective Radius from Energy Density}

From the normalized energy density we compute the effective spatial variance:
\[
R_{\text{eff}}^2 = \frac{\int r^2 T_{00}(\vec{x})\, d^3x}{\int T_{00}(\vec{x})\, d^3x} = 5R^2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad R = \frac{R_{\text{eff}}}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

\section*{Conclusion}

The parameter \( R \) used in the self-energy calculation is not a free constant. It is uniquely determined by the topological field solution \(\Theta_1\), completing the prediction of the electron mass from first principles.
