\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix 19: Visual Maps of Field Dynamics and Conscious Structures}

This appendix presents visual representations of the core structures and dynamics introduced in the Unified Biquaternion Theory. Each visualization is accompanied by both a rigorous mathematical description and a conceptual interpretation aimed at broader accessibility.

\subsection*{A. Toroidal Field of Consciousness: \(\mathbf{g}_\psi\)}

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Toroidal structure of the \(\mathbf{g}_\psi\) field.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Explanation:} The torus represents the topological structure of internal conscious space (\(\psi\)). The vector field on its surface visualizes the imaginary part of the curvature tensor \(\mathbf{R}\), i.e., \(\mathbf{g}_\psi = \operatorname{Im}(\mathbf{R})\). Phase loops within this topology correspond to stable domains of subjective experience.

\textbf{Interpretation:} Each closed loop encodes a self-sustained conscious state. Interference patterns correspond to entanglement or phase collisions between distinct domains.

\subsection*{B. Spectrum of \(\Phi^\psi\): Phase Oscillations and Harmonics}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{phi_spectrum_psi.png}
\caption{Discrete spectral structure of the internal phase field \(\Phi^\psi\).}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Explanation:} The field \(\Phi^\psi\) is a modulated phase function defined over \(\psi\). Its decomposition yields discrete eigenmodes, associated with stable conscious harmonics.

\textbf{Interpretation:} Each peak in the spectrum represents a preferred mode of internal processing, possibly linked to attention, memory, or emotion states. These modes correspond to solutions of the scalar field equation in Appendix 11.

\subsection*{C. Interference and Conscious Domains}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{interference_domains.png}
\caption{Interference of two \(\psi\)-based modes forming a localized domain.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Explanation:} Superposition of two close phase modes leads to constructive/destructive interference in \(\psi\), creating localized energetic domains.

\textbf{Interpretation:} Such interference could correspond to emergence of perceptual focus, internal conflicts, or restructuring of conscious representation.

\subsection*{D. Psychon Condensate}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{psychon_condensate.png}
\caption{Model of a toroidal condensate of psychon fields.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Explanation:} A coherent cluster of phase-coupled excitations in the \(\Theta(q, \tau)\) field forms a condensate, possibly protected topologically within the extended phase-space structure (which can be viewed as \(\mathbb{C}^5\) when making the imaginary time coordinate \(\psi\) explicit, or equivalently as embedded in \(\mathbb{B}^4\) when using the biquaternionic formulation).

\textbf{Interpretation:} This may be the fundamental unit of self-aware consciousness: a persistent, structured excitation across complex internal dimensions.
