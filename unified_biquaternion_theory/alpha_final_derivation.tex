\section{Fundamental Postulate from UBT}

The Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) introduces a complexified time coordinate
\[
\tau = t + i\psi
\]
with the topology of a torus \( T^2 \). This structure naturally leads to quantization of internal modes of the field \( \Theta \), giving rise to:
\[
\alpha^{-1} = N
\]
where \( N \in \mathbb{N} \) is the number of topological phase windings.

\section{Selection of \( N = 137 \)}

From topological constraints (gauge invariance, monodromy) and requirement of compatibility with the QED interaction term, we find:
\[
N = 137 \Rightarrow \alpha_0 = \frac{1}{137}
\]

\section{Comparison with Experimental Value}

The current experimental value is:
\[
\alpha_{\text{exp}}^{-1} = 137.035999084(21)
\]
Difference:
\[
\Delta = \alpha_{\text{exp}}^{-1} - \alpha_0^{-1} \approx 0.035999084
\]

\section{Note on Running Coupling and Energy Scales}

The QED coupling constant runs with energy scale according to:
\[
\alpha(Q^2) = \frac{\alpha(\mu^2)}{1 - \frac{\alpha(\mu^2)}{3\pi} \log(Q^2/\mu^2)}
\]
In QED, the coupling \emph{increases} with energy (i.e., $\alpha^{-1}$ decreases as $Q^2$ increases).

The experimental value $\alpha_{\text{exp}}^{-1} = 137.035999084(21)$ is measured at low energy (Thomson scattering limit, effectively $Q^2 \to 0$). At higher energies, such as the $Z$ boson mass scale, one finds $\alpha^{-1}(M_Z^2) \approx 128$.

\section{Interpretation of the UBT Prediction}

The UBT prediction of $\alpha_0^{-1} = 137$ from topological quantization is remarkably close to the low-energy experimental value. The small discrepancy of $\sim 0.036$ could arise from:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum corrections beyond the leading topological approximation
\item Contributions from the extended biquaternionic structure
\item Mixing with higher-dimensional modes
\end{itemize}

The agreement to better than $0.03\%$ provides support for the topological origin of the fine-structure constant in the UBT framework, while the residual difference indicates that quantum and geometric corrections beyond the classical winding number are needed for precision predictions.

\section{Conclusion}

UBT theory predicts $\alpha_0^{-1} = 137$ from topological quantization of phase windings on the complex time torus. This prediction agrees with the experimental low-energy value $\alpha_{\text{exp}}^{-1} = 137.036$ to within $0.03\%$, suggesting a geometric origin for this fundamental constant. The small discrepancy likely reflects quantum corrections to the semiclassical topological formula.
