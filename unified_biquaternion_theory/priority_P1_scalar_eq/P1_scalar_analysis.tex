\section*{Goal}
Explore the physical and mathematical meaning of the imaginary scalar equation derived from the unified field equation $\Theta(q, \tau)$.

\section*{Equation of Interest}
From the scalar-imaginary projection:
\[
\Im[\text{Sc}(\mathcal{D}_q \Theta(q, \tau))] = 0
\]

\section*{Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze its form under spherical symmetry and FRW cosmology.
\item Test if this reduces to a constraint on topology or yields new scalar fields.
\item Examine links to axion/dilaton or inflaton-like dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}
\item Write $\Theta$ under spherical symmetry.
\item Perform symbolic computation of imaginary scalar part.
\item Solve for specific boundary conditions.
\end{itemize}
