\section*{Hypothesis}
The $\chi(q)$ component of the field encodes mental state oscillations. Decision-making can be modeled as bifurcation in a low-dimensional system governed by free energy minimization.

\section*{Model Idea}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use 1D reduced dynamics: $\chi(q) \sim \psi(t)$
\item Introduce potential landscape $F(\psi)$ with bistable points.
\item Evolve using Fokker–Planck-like dynamics:
\[
\frac{\partial \rho(\psi,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \psi} \left( \mu(\psi) \rho \right) + D \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial \psi^2}
\]
\end{itemize}

\section*{Goal}
Show this reproduces "choice" dynamics as spontaneous symmetry breaking or collapse.
