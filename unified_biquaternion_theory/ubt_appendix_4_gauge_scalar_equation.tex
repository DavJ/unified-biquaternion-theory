\section*{1. Introduction}

In previous appendices, we demonstrated that the real part of the scalar projection of the biquaternionic field equation yields the Einstein field equations. In Appendix 3, we interpreted the imaginary part of the connection \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_I\) as a gauge potential \(\mathbf{A}_\mu\), and its corresponding curvature \(\mathbf{R}_I\) as a field strength tensor \(\mathbf{F}_{\mu\nu ab}\).

In this appendix, we analyze the resulting scalar constraint:
\[
\text{Scal}(e^\mu_a e^\nu_b \mathbf{F}_{\mu\nu}^{ab}) = 0,
\]
which we interpret as a Ricci scalar equation for the gauge field.

\section*{2. Geometrical Interpretation}

This equation is not of the standard Yang-Mills form:
\[
\mathcal{D}_\mu \mathbf{F}^{\mu\nu} = 0,
\]
but rather a geometric constraint derived from a contraction over two tetrads and the gauge curvature. It resembles a trace-like condition:
\[
\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{F}_{\mu\nu} e^\mu e^\nu) = 0.
\]
It tells us that the scalar projection of the gauge field curvature must vanish.

\section*{3. Flat Background Case}

In a flat spacetime with Minkowski metric \( \eta_{\mu\nu} \), we assume:
\[
e^\mu_a = \delta^\mu_a, \quad e^a_\mu = \delta^a_\mu,
\]
and vanishing gravitational connection:
\[
\boldsymbol{\omega}_R = 0.
\]
Under this simplification, the curvature \(\mathbf{F}_{\mu\nu ab}\) reduces to:
\[
\mathbf{F}_{\mu\nu ab} = \partial_\mu \mathbf{A}_{\nu ab} - \partial_\nu \mathbf{A}_{\mu ab} + [\mathbf{A}_{\mu}, \mathbf{A}_{\nu}]_{ab}.
\]
The constraint becomes:
\[
\text{Scal}(\mathbf{F}_{\mu\nu}^{\mu\nu}) = 0.
\]
This resembles a condition on the trace of the gauge field strength in Minkowski space.

\section*{4. Physical Implications}

Unlike standard gauge fields that satisfy wave-like propagation equations, this field satisfies a purely algebraic constraint. Possible interpretations include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A geometric constraint that selects physically allowed configurations of the gauge field.
  \item A condition on the internal consistency of the field \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_I\), possibly related to quantum information flow or entropy.
  \item A candidate for new physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark matter, topological fields, or holographic constraints.
\end{itemize}

\section*{5. Conclusion and Next Steps}

We have derived a new constraint equation for the imaginary gauge field originating from the biquaternionic structure. This constraint does not resemble Yang-Mills dynamics but instead introduces a novel geometric condition. Future work will investigate:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solutions of this equation in symmetric spacetimes (e.g., cosmological or spherically symmetric).
  \item Interaction with matter fields.
  \item Its role in entropy, information theory, or dark sector phenomenology.
\end{itemize}
