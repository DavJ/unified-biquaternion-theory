# Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) — v17 Stable Release Summary

Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) formulates a unified geometric field based on the complex-time biquaternion function Θ(q, τ), where τ = t + iψ.  
This release integrates gravitational, electromagnetic, and quantum interactions within a single algebraic topology derived from quaternionic metrics.

## 🔬 Summary of Advancements
- Verified alignment of all appendices (A–M) under the unified Θ(q, τ) formalism.  
- Consciousness and Psychon fields isolated to speculative appendix.  
- Constants stabilized: Θ₀ = 1.054×10⁻³⁴ J·s.  
- Predictive deviations of α and mₑ below 1%.  
- Compatible with SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) gauge symmetries.
