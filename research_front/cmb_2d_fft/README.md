# 2D FFT CMB Skew Test (Research Front)

Status: exploratory / hypothesis testing

Goal:
Test whether a small anisotropic tilt (~arctan(1/256)) is detectable
in 2D Fourier space of local CMB patches.

Important:
- This is NOT part of Core UBT.
- This test is not pre-registered.
- Any positive result requires independent replication and null tests.

Failure to detect the signal is a valid outcome.
