# UBT-CLOCK-TB-001 — Clock shear formulated in primary biquaternionic time

## Goal
Write a **speculative but mathematically disciplined** note describing *clock shear* starting from primary biquaternionic time `T_B`, with complex time `τ` appearing only as a derived limit/projection.

## Scope
This is a new note in the speculative area. It must not be treated as canonical unless later promoted under repo governance.

## Instructions
1. Create a new file:
   - `speculative_extensions/notes/clock_shear_in_TB.md`
2. Structure:
   - **(A) Primary definition:** time as `T_B ∈ 𝔹` with the minimal required algebraic operations.
   - **(B) Observer / transformation:** define a generic biquaternionic transformation acting on `T_B`.
   - **(C) Projection limit:** define the conditions under which `τ = t + iψ` is a valid projection/limit.
     - Must reference:
       - `consolidation_project/appendix_N2_extension_biquaternion_time.tex`
       - `TRANSITION_CRITERION_COMPLEX_BIQUATERNIONIC.md`
   - **(D) Where shear appears:** show that “shear” is an effect visible **after** projection, not necessarily in the full `T_B` object.
   - **(E) One falsifiable qualitative prediction:** a clear signature that differs from “pure metric expansion” framing.
3. Clearly label each section’s **time regime**:
   - `Time regime: T_B (primary)`
   - `Time regime: τ (projection/limit; criterion required)`

## Constraints
- ❌ Do not claim `τ` is fundamental.
- ❌ No data fitting.
- ✅ Be explicit about assumptions.
- ✅ Keep math consistent with existing repo definitions.

## Definition of done
- The note exists at the specified path.
- It references the established time-transition criteria.
- It cleanly separates primary `T_B` reasoning from projected `τ` reasoning.
