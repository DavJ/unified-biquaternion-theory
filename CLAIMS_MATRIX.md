## Canonical / Research Claims

| Claim | Status | Primary source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Derived metric chain and GR recovery in admissible real projection | PROVED | `canonical/gr_closure/`, `papers/UBT_GR_Submission.tex` | Canonical core claim |
| Regge–Wheeler odd-parity graviton equation recovery | PROVED | `papers/UBT_GR_Submission.tex`, `canonical/gr_closure/` | Canonical GR perturbation chain |
| Zerilli even-parity graviton equation recovery | PROVED | `canonical/gr_closure/zerilli_derivation.tex` | Canonical closure item |
| Standard-model gauge-structure recovery track (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) structural chain) | DERIVED_WITH_ASSUMPTIONS | `canonical/interactions/`, `canonical/su3_derivation/`, `papers/UBT_Gauge_Submission.tex` | Formal chain present; remaining sector-specific closures explicit |
| Three-generation structural route from ψ-winding framework | DERIVED_WITH_ASSUMPTIONS | `canonical/n_eff/`, `canonical/interactions/` | Mechanism documented with explicit assumptions |
| Full α closure from first principles (including blocker derivations) | OPEN_GAP | `canonical/alpha/ALPHA_MASTER_STATUS.md`, `canonical/alpha/PRIMARY_ROUTE.md` | Gap inventory remains active |
| N_eff-related route support for α track | DERIVED_WITH_ASSUMPTIONS | `canonical/n_eff/` | Must not be overstated as full α proof |
| Numerical reproducibility tracks (diagnostics/validation) | NUMERICAL_EVIDENCE | `research_tracks/`, `tools/`, `experiments/` | Reproducible evidence, not theorem-level proof |
| Full UBT quantum field theory closure (Hilbert/Born/measurement/path-integral completeness) | OPEN_GAP | `src/ubt/quantum/`, `docs/quantum_sector_status.md` | Numerical scaffold exists; derivation chain remains open |
| Born rule derived from UBT | OPEN_GAP | `src/ubt/quantum/quantum_scaffold.py`, `docs/quantum_sector_status.md` | Placeholder only |
| Path-integral measure in biquaternionic coordinates | OPEN_GAP | `src/ubt/quantum/quantum_scaffold.py`, `docs/quantum_sector_status.md` | `NotDerivedPathIntegralKernel` is explicit placeholder |
| Finite-energy soliton regularization | NUMERICAL_EVIDENCE | `src/ubt/solitons/regularization.py`, `research_tracks/renormalization/finite_energy_soliton_regularization.md` | Regularized finite-energy model; full RG derivation open |
| Renormalization group from UBT action | OPEN_GAP | `research_tracks/renormalization/finite_energy_soliton_regularization.md` | No RG-flow derivation claimed |
| UBT derives weak parity violation | CONJECTURE | `src/ubt/algebra/chirality.py`, `research_tracks/weak_sector/chirality_and_parity_status.md` | Chirality algebra scaffold only; no SU(2)_L coupling derivation |
| Anomalous magnetic moment prediction from UBT | OPEN_GAP | `src/ubt/observables/physics_observable_bridge.py`, `docs/observable_bridge.md` | Bridge returns structured open-gap status |

## Explicitly Speculative Claims (non-canonical)

Unless a reproducible empirical protocol upgrades them, the following remain **SPECULATIVE**:

| Claim | Status | Location |
|---|---|---|
| consciousness field | SPECULATIVE | `speculative_extensions/consciousness/` |
| psychons as physical particles | SPECULATIVE | `speculative_extensions/consciousness/` |
| afterlife | SPECULATIVE | `speculative_extensions/` |
| survival of consciousness | SPECULATIVE | `speculative_extensions/` |
| communication with deceased consciousness | SPECULATIVE | `speculative_extensions/` |
| ThetaComm | SPECULATIVE | `speculative_extensions/thetacomm/` (or equivalent speculative path) |
| soul / immortality | SPECULATIVE | `speculative_extensions/` |
| Matrix / simulation ontology | SPECULATIVE | `speculative_extensions/metaphysics/` (or equivalent speculative path) |
