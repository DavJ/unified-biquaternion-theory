## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for moving UBT from a self-assessed research framework into peer-reviewed scientific literature. The goal is to validate the mathematics, expose hidden assumptions, and establish scientific credibility through independent expert review.

## Submission Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Papers (Year 1)

**Prerequisites:**
- Complete mathematical foundations (see MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS_TODO.md)
- Address all gaps identified in mathematical review
- Independent verification of proofs

**Expected Challenges:**

## Collaboration and Authorship

### Solo vs. Collaborative Papers

**Current Status:** UBT developed primarily by David Jaroš

**Recommendations:**
1. **Mathematical foundations:** Consider collaboration with mathematical physicist
2. **GR recovery:** Could be solo or with GR expert consultation
3. **Fine-structure constant:** Solo initially, collaboration for calculations
4. **Experimental predictions:** Collaboration with experimentalists essential

### Authorship Guidelines
- **Sole author:** Papers primarily developed independently
- **First author:** Papers with significant contributions from others
- **Collaboration:** Papers requiring expertise beyond theory (experiments, simulations)

### Acknowledgments
- Thank anyone who provided feedback on preprints
- Acknowledge computational resources used
- Thank funding sources (if any)

## Preprint Strategy

### arXiv Posting
**Advantages:**
- Establishes priority
- Allows community feedback before journal submission
- Increases visibility
- Free and standard practice in physics

**Recommendations:**
- Post to arXiv BEFORE journal submission for Papers 1A, 1B
- Post to arXiv AFTER acceptance for Papers 2A, 2B (to avoid journal issues)
- Use appropriate categories: gr-qc, hep-th, math-ph
- Update with journal reference after publication

### OSF/Zenodo
**Current Status:** v10 prepared for Zenodo upload

**Recommendations:**
- Upload consolidated document with DOI
- Link from arXiv papers
- Update after peer review revisions

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Complete rejection by journals

- Publish erratum if needed
- Continue with validated portions

### Risk: Theory deemed unfalsifiable
**Mitigation:**
- Develop testable predictions first
- Submit experimental proposals alongside theory
- Collaborate with experimentalists early

### Risk: Dismissed as numerology
**Mitigation:**
- Eliminate all fitted parameters
- Calculate multiple related predictions
- Compare to other theoretical frameworks
- Emphasize mathematical structure over numerical coincidences

## Conclusion

Peer review is essential for UBT to progress from individual research to community-accepted science. This roadmap provides a realistic path forward, acknowledging both the theory's potential and its current limitations.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Start with least controversial aspects** (GR recovery, mathematical foundations)
2. **Build credibility incrementally** through multiple publications
3. **Welcome criticism** as improving the theory
4. **Be honest** about limitations and uncertainties
5. **Focus on falsifiable predictions** rather than unfalsifiable claims

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete mathematical foundations (MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS_TODO.md)
2. Prepare Paper 1B manuscript (GR recovery)
3. Post preprint to arXiv
4. Submit to Classical and Quantum Gravity
5. Iterate based on feedback
