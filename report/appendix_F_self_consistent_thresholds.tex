\section*{Appendix F — Self-consistent thresholds without PDG}
We derive $\alpha_0$ and $m_0$ from the stationary action on the $(t,\psi)$ torus, impose Hecke stability (fixing $\alpha_0^{-1}=137$), and evolve $\alpha(\mu)$ using geometric $\beta$-functions to two and three loops. Thresholds are not taken from experimental masses; instead they are absorbed self-consistently by solving lepton fixed-point equations against the same running.
