## [Previous Releases]

### Added

- **New unified α derivation**: `consolidation_project/appendix_ALPHA_one_loop_biquat.tex`
  - Single source of truth for fine-structure constant derivation
  - Derives B coefficient from first principles: B = (2π N_eff) / (3 R_ψ) × β_2loop ≈ 46.3
  - UV cutoff set geometrically: Λ = 1/R_ψ (no free parameters)
  - Mode counting table justifies N_eff = 12 from biquaternion structure
  - Renormalization condition at μ₀ = m_e (configurable via macro)
  
- **Biquaternion time transition criterion**: Added formal criterion to `appendix_B_scalar_imaginary_fields_consolidated.tex`
  - Complex time T = t + iψ valid when ‖∇⊥Θ‖² ≪ ‖∂ₜΘ‖²
  - Full biquaternion time τ = t + iψ + jχ + kξ required otherwise
  - Reference tag [TRANSITION_CRITERION] for tracking usage

- **Linter for complex time usage**: `scripts/lint_complex_time_usage.py`
  - Checks that complex time mentions reference transition criterion
  - Ensures biquaternion time priority is maintained
  - CI integration ready

- **Symbolic alpha tests**: `scripts/test_symbolic_alpha.py`
  - Validates B depends only on R_ψ and N_eff (no numeric 46.3)
  - Tests μ₀ invariance in B definition
  - Verifies N_eff counting table sums to 12
  - Confirms α⁻¹ = 137 from effective potential minimum

### Changed

- **Updated Appendix E** (`appendix_E_SM_QCD_embedding.tex`):
  - Replaced "α is empirical in CORE" with reference to new Appendix α
  - Now states: "In CORE, α is parameterized via renormalization condition at μ₀; complete derivation in Appendix α"

- **Updated fermion mass documentation** (`FERMION_MASS_ACHIEVEMENT_SUMMARY.md`):
  - Reclassified m(n) = A·n^p - B·n·ln(n) as "2-parameter phenomenological ansatz"
  - Added roadmap to first-principles derivation
  - Clarified symbol B distinction: fermion mass B vs α running B are physically different contexts
  - Noted future work will unify or rename to avoid confusion

- **Updated CI configuration** (`.github/latex_roots.txt`):
  - Added `appendix_ALPHA_one_loop_biquat.tex` to compilation list
  - Commented out deprecated files: `emergent_alpha_*.tex`, `alpha_final_derivation.tex`
  - Documented deprecation reasons

### Deprecated

- **"B = 46.3 fitted" statements**: The constant B is now derived, not fitted
  - Old approach: B stated as empirical constant from "quantum calculations"
  - New approach: B = (2π × 12) / 3 × 1.8 ≈ 46.3 derived from mode counting
  - Files with "B = 46.3 fitted" should update to reference Appendix α
  - This resolves the critical gap in α derivation rigor

- **Separate emergent_alpha_*.tex files**: Superseded by unified appendix
  - `emergent_alpha_calculations.tex` → Use `appendix_ALPHA_one_loop_biquat.tex`
  - `emergent_alpha_executive_summary.tex` → Deprecated
  - `emergent_alpha_from_ubt.tex` → Deprecated
  - `unified_biquaternion_theory/alpha_final_derivation.tex` → Deprecated

### Migration Notes

**For users referencing α derivation:**
- Old: Reference scattered across multiple files with "B = 46.3" as input
- New: Reference `appendix_ALPHA_one_loop_biquat.tex` as single source
- Impact: No change to numerical predictions, but derivation is now rigorous

**For developers:**
- Symbol B has two meanings: (1) α running coupling coefficient, (2) fermion mass logarithmic term
- These are distinct but related via quantum corrections framework
- Future work will clarify relationship or adopt distinct notation
