=== Integrating Appendix E (m0, strict no‑fit) ===

1) Place 'appendix_E_m0_derivation_strict.tex' next to your main LaTeX sources.

2) In your main .tex, include near the end:
   \clearpage
   \input{appendix_E_m0_derivation_strict.tex}

3) Cross-references:
   - C: geometric origin of α(μ) and β-function
   - D: lepton fixed-point equations and strict/calibrated scripts
   - E: strict derivation of m0 from the UBT action on the (t,ψ) torus

4) Build as usual:
   pdflatex main.tex
   bibtex (if any)
   pdflatex main.tex
   pdflatex main.tex
