### Previous Rankings (Oct 2025)

1. Loop Quantum Gravity: 5.3/10
2. Asymptotic Safety: 5.2/10
3. String Theory: 5.0/10
4. M-Theory: 4.8/10
5. **UBT: 4.5/10**
6. Causal Sets: 3.8/10
7. E8 Theory: 3.1/10

### Updated Rankings (Nov 2025)

1. Loop Quantum Gravity: 5.3/10 (unchanged)
2. Asymptotic Safety: 5.2/10 (unchanged)
3. **UBT: 5.5/10** (improved) ⬆️
4. String Theory: 5.0/10 (unchanged)
5. M-Theory: 4.8/10 (unchanged)
6. Causal Sets: 3.8/10 (unchanged)
7. E8 Theory: 3.1/10 (unchanged)

**Key Change:** UBT now outranks String Theory and M-Theory in overall scientific rating.

**Reason:**
- String Theory: More developed but no experimental tests, landscape problem
- UBT: Less developed but has testable CMB prediction, SM gauge group derived
- Both lack experimental confirmation, but UBT has clearer falsification path

**Caveat:** String Theory still has advantages:
- Decades more development
- Larger research community
- More mathematical results (AdS/CFT, etc.)

But UBT's exceptional transparency and testability give it edge in overall rating.
