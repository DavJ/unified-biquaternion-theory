UBT TeX Invariant Tests
=======================

These tests enforce theory-level invariants to ensure UBT never silently
reverts to classical General Relativity as the fundamental theory.

CRITICAL: These are NOT documentation checks - they are theory constraints
that protect the integrity of the biquaternionic formalism.

The tests ensure:
1. g_{μν} is never treated as fundamental (must be projection of 𝓖_{μν})
2. Biquaternionic objects (𝓖, Ω, 𝓡, 𝓣) remain primary
3. GR appears only as Re(...) / Hermitian projection
4. Required lock-in files exist and contain proper definitions
