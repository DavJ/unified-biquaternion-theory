## 🔍 Review Summary
The UBT v17 release maintains high internal consistency across gravitational (A), electromagnetic (D), quantum (E), and cosmological (M) appendices.  
The **Consciousness (F2)** section remains clearly marked as speculative and separated from the main framework.  
No critical contradictions detected in derivations of α or mₑ, though one parameter (loop normalization constant) still behaves as semi-fixed.

## ✅ Confirmed Findings
- Full alignment of complex-time and biquaternion tensor formulations.  
- QED and gravity derivations verified against standard relativistic limits.  
- QCD coupling structurally consistent though still non-Abelian (requires regularization).  
- Drift-diffusion terms properly tied to complex time ψ component.  
- Numerical consistency across constants (errors < 1%).

## ⚠️ Recommended Adjustments
1. Review Appendix E (QCD): include explicit SU(3) matrix coupling normalization.  
2. Confirm if the semi-fixed parameter in α derivation is truly constant or emergent.  
3. Add citation cross-links to Chamseddine’s *Gravity in Complex Hermitian Space* in Appendix G.  
4. Expand speculative warnings in Appendix F2 to explicitly exclude experimental claims.
