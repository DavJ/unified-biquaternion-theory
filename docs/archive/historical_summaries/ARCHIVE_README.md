## Note on Historical Preservation

These documents are preserved to maintain a record of the theory's development and the iterative improvement process. They demonstrate:
- How the theory has evolved over time
- The transparent self-assessment process
- Historical context for current decisions
- Lessons learned during development

However, they should not be cited as current status - always refer to the latest documentation in the root directory.
