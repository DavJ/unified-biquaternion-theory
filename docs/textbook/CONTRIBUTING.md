# Contributing to the UBT Textbook
**Goal:** engineer-friendly overview. Keep core vs. proofs vs. speculative strictly separated.
- Reuse main paper content via `\input{../../...}` to avoid divergence.
- Style: short intros per chapter + `\input{}` of canonical sources.
- PRs: add small, focused improvements; include a quick build check (`latexmk -pdf`).
