## Spacetime and Complex Time

| Symbol | Description | Units | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|
| τ | Complex time: τ = t + iψ | [time] | Fundamental to UBT |
| t | Real time coordinate | [time] | Standard temporal dimension |
| ψ | Imaginary time/phase coordinate | [dimensionless] or [time] | Internal/cognitive dynamics |
| x^μ | Spacetime coordinates (μ=0,1,2,3) | [length] | Standard Lorentzian |
| q^μ | Biquaternion coordinates | — | On manifold ℬ⁴ |
| ℬ⁴ | Biquaternionic manifold: (ℂ⊗ℍ)⁴ | — | Core geometric structure |
| ℂ⁵ | 5D complex manifold (x^μ, ψ) | — | Alternative formulation |

**Complex Time Details:**
- τ = t + iψ where t is real (observable) time and ψ is phase/imaginary component
- Topology: 𝕋² (2-torus) due to ψ ~ ψ + 2πR_ψ
- Physical interpretation: t = external evolution, ψ = internal phase dynamics

## Quantum Constants

| Symbol | Description | Value | Status in UBT |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| α | Fine-structure constant | 1/137.035999084 | **Empirical input (CODATA 2018)** |
| B or B_α | Vacuum polarization coefficient | ≈ 46.3 | Fitted in current UBT |

### Important: B Constant Disambiguation

The symbol **B** appears in TWO distinct contexts:

1. **B_α in fine-structure constant running:**
   - Dimensionless coefficient
   - Formula: 1/α(μ) = 1/α(μ₀) + (B_α/2π)ln(μ/μ₀)
   - Value: B_α ≈ 46.3 (EMPIRICALLY FITTED)
   - Physical origin: Photon vacuum polarization
   - Reference: appendix_P4_alpha_status.tex

2. **B_m in fermion mass formula:**
   - Energy-dimensioned coefficient (units: MeV)
   - Formula: m(n) = A·n^p - B_m·n·ln(n)
   - Value: B_m ≈ -14.099 MeV (EMPIRICALLY FITTED)
   - Physical origin: Fermion self-energy corrections
   - Reference: FERMION_MASS_ACHIEVEMENT_SUMMARY.md

**These are physically distinct but conceptually related** (both arise from one-loop quantum corrections).

See `SYMBOL_B_USAGE_CLARIFICATION.md` for detailed discussion.

## p-Adic Extensions (Speculative)

⚠️ **WARNING: p-Adic multiverse is speculative extension, not core UBT.**

**Interpretation:** Different primes p may correspond to different "universe sectors" with varying coupling constants.

**Status:** Highly speculative. No experimental evidence or testable predictions currently exist.
