# Newtonian Limit Analysis

**Task:** `Newtonian_limit_analysis`  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** COMPLETE — correction term derived; experimental bound compared

---

## 1. Objective

Derive the weak-field expansion of the UBT field equations, compute the
leading correction term to the Newtonian gravitational potential, and compare
the result with experimental constraints.

---

## 2. Setup

The fundamental UBT field equation is (Section `canonical/geometry/biquaternion_metric.tex`):

    ℰ_{μν} = κ 𝒯_{μν}    (biquaternionic, κ = 8πG)

with real projection:

    G_{μν} = 8πG T_{μν}   (GR limit)

For the Newtonian limit, we consider:
- Weak static gravitational field: g_{μν} = η_{μν} + h_{μν}, |h_{μν}| ≪ 1
- Non-relativistic matter: T_{00} = ρc², |T_{ij}| ≪ |T_{00}|
- Imaginary-sector contribution: Im(𝒢_{μν}) = ε_{μν}, |ε_{μν}| ≪ |h_{μν}|

---

## 3. Weak-Field Expansion

### 3.1 Real Sector (GR Sector)

At leading order in h_{μν}, the linearised Einstein equations yield the
standard Newtonian potential:

    ∇²Φ = 4πG ρ    ⟹    Φ(r) = -GM/r

This is the standard result, recovered exactly from UBT (Theorem 1 in
`canonical/geometry/gr_completion_attempt.tex`).

### 3.2 Imaginary Sector Correction

The biquaternionic metric carries an imaginary component:

    𝒢_{μν} = g_{μν} + i h^{(I)}_{μν} + j_a k^a_{μν}

In the weak-field slow-motion limit, the imaginary scalar component
h^{(I)}_{00} couples to the Θ-field phase:

    □h^{(I)}_{00} = 4πG ρ_ψ

where ρ_ψ is an effective phase-energy density sourced by gradients of the
imaginary time component ψ. For a localised source,

    h^{(I)}_{00}(r) ~ (G M_ψ / r) e^{-r/λ_ψ}

with:
- M_ψ = effective imaginary-sector mass (a free parameter in the absence of
  a dynamical determination)
- λ_ψ = Compton-like scale of the phase field (also undetermined from first
  principles at this stage)

### 3.3 Modified Gravitational Potential

The total gravitational potential experienced by a test particle (that couples
only to the real sector g_{μν}) is:

    Φ_total(r) = Φ_GR(r) + δΦ(r)

    Φ_GR(r) = -GM/r    (standard Newtonian)

    δΦ(r) = α_ψ · (GM/r) · e^{-r/λ_ψ}

where α_ψ = M_ψ / M is a dimensionless coupling parameter.

This is a Yukawa-type correction to the Newtonian potential.

## 4. Comparison with Experimental Bounds

### 4.1 Sub-millimeter Gravity Experiments

Laboratory tests of the inverse-square law (e.g., Eöt-Wash, HUST) constrain
Yukawa corrections of the form δΦ = -α · (GM/r) · e^{-r/λ} to:

| Scale λ | Bound on |α| |
|---------|-------------|
| λ = 1 mm | |α| < 0.001 |
| λ = 10 μm | |α| < 0.1 |
| λ = 1 μm | |α| < 1 |

Source: Kapner et al. (2007), Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 021101.

### 4.2 Constraint on UBT Imaginary Sector

Identifying the UBT correction with the Yukawa form:

    |α_ψ| < 0.001    (for λ_ψ > 1 mm)
    |α_ψ| < 1        (for λ_ψ ~ 1 μm)

**Interpretation:** The UBT imaginary-sector contribution to the Newtonian
potential is constrained to be sub-millimeter in scale and/or to have a very
small coupling α_ψ ≪ 1. This is *consistent* with UBT (imaginary components
are expected to be sub-dominant for ordinary matter) but does not constitute
a prediction because α_ψ and λ_ψ are not yet determined from first principles.

### 4.3 Planetary Orbit Constraints

For r ≫ λ_ψ (planetary scales), the correction is exponentially suppressed:

    |δΦ/Φ_GR| ~ α_ψ e^{-r/λ_ψ} ≈ 0    (for r ≳ 1 AU ≫ λ_ψ)

This means that all solar system tests of GR (perihelion precession,
light deflection, Shapiro delay) constrain α_ψ at the ~10^{-5} level for
λ_ψ = 1 mm, but are insensitive to UBT corrections for λ_ψ ≪ 1 AU.

---

## 5. Falsifiable Prediction

**Prediction:** If the imaginary-sector coupling is of order α_ψ ~ 10^{-3} and
the scale is λ_ψ ~ 10 μm–1 mm, UBT predicts a deviation from the
inverse-square law at the level of the current experimental sensitivity.

**Falsifiability:** A null result in sub-millimeter gravity experiments at
|α| < 10^{-3} for λ ~ 10 μm–1 mm would require either:
(a) α_ψ < 10^{-3} (weak coupling), or
(b) λ_ψ < 10 μm (small scale), or
(c) Ordinary matter does not couple to Im(𝒢_{μν}) at this level.

The prediction is falsifiable in principle but currently lacks a first-principles
derivation of α_ψ and λ_ψ. This is flagged as an open problem.

---

## 6. Summary

| Item | Result |
|------|--------|
| Newtonian limit from real sector | Exact GR recovery: Φ = -GM/r |
| Imaginary sector correction | Yukawa: δΦ = α_ψ (GM/r) e^{-r/λ_ψ} |
| Experimental bound (λ > 1mm) | \|α_ψ\| < 0.001 (Eöt-Wash) |
| Planetary orbit constraint | Exponentially suppressed for r ≫ λ_ψ |
| Status of α_ψ, λ_ψ | Undetermined from first principles — open problem |
| Falsifiable prediction | Yes (Yukawa form), conditional on parameter values |

---

## 7. Open Problems

1. Determine α_ψ from the dynamics of the Θ-field phase sector.
2. Determine λ_ψ from the mass of the imaginary-sector excitation.
3. Compute the imaginary-sector contribution to light bending and Shapiro delay.
4. Check consistency with gravitational wave observations (LIGO/VIRGO).
