# Standard Model Embedding Roadmap

© 2025 Ing. David Jaroš — CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

This document lists the elements required for a complete derivation of the Standard
Model (SM) from the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT).  Each item is currently an
**open problem** unless explicitly marked as resolved.

> **Important**: No current UBT document constitutes a complete derivation of the
> Standard Model. The framework provides candidate geometric structures that *support*
> SM-like gauge symmetry, but full derivation remains outstanding.

## Gauge Group Structure

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| U(1)_Y hypercharge quantization | **Open** | Why are hypercharges rational? Not derived from biquaternion structure. |
| SU(2)_L weak isospin | **Partial** | Quaternion subalgebra gives SU(2)-like structure; but chirality (L vs R) not derived. |
| SU(3)_C color symmetry | **Candidate construction only** | See Appendix G; three imaginary axes ≠ SU(3) without additional assumptions. |
| Full SM group G_SM = SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) | **Open** | Decoupling of factors not demonstrated; direct product structure not derived. |

## Matter Content

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Three generations of quarks and leptons | **Open** | Why exactly 3? No mechanism from biquaternion geometry. |
| Chirality mechanism (L/R asymmetry) | **Open** | Key missing piece; biquaternionic structure is formally symmetric. |
| Quark color quantum numbers | **Open** | Dependent on SU(3) derivation (see above). |
| Lepton number conservation | **Open** | No mechanism demonstrated. |

## Mass Generation

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Higgs mechanism / EWSB | **Open** | Phase structure of Θ provides candidate, but SSB not derived. |
| Yukawa structure | **Open** | Why the observed hierarchy m_e ≪ m_μ ≪ m_τ? Candidate: toroidal eigenmodes (Appendix W, conjecture). |
| Neutrino masses and mixing | **Open** | Seesaw candidate in Appendix G6; not derived from first principles. |
| CKM mixing matrix | **Open** | Appendix QA2 presents candidates; no full derivation. |

## Anomaly Cancellation

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Gauge anomaly cancellation | **Open** | Not analyzed in biquaternion framework. |
| Gravitational anomaly cancellation | **Open** | Not analyzed. |

## Running Couplings

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Fine structure constant α | **Partial** | Specific numerical derivation exists but relies on auxiliary assumptions (see reports/alpha_audit/). |
| Strong coupling α_s | **Open** | Not derived from first principles. |
| Weinberg angle θ_W | **Open** | Candidate in Appendix K2; not a full derivation. |

## Language Policy

All UBT documents must use the following phrasings:

| Instead of | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| "UBT derives the Standard Model" | "UBT framework supports candidate gauge structures; full derivation remains open." |
| "SU(3) emerges from biquaternions" | "A candidate mechanism for SU(3)-like structure is presented; see Appendix G for open problems." |
| "The three generations are explained" | "A candidate mechanism (toroidal eigenmodes) is proposed; verification pending." |
