# Canonical UBT Directory

This directory contains the **current-best, internally consistent, low-speculation** version of Unified Biquaternion Theory: what the theory currently treats as correct, preferably proved, reproduced, or clearly established as the canonical mainline.

## Purpose

`canonical/` is the **single reference formulation** of UBT for resolving conflicts and duplications.  
It is **stricter** than the historical or conceptual scope of the repository:

- Not all historical UBT material belongs here.
- Conceptual-only, unformalized, or speculative tracks do **not** belong here.
- Only current-best and sufficiently established material stays.
- **Speculative extensions** (including consciousness / psychons, universe-as-atom, fingerprint/parity side-tracks) are **not** part of canonical UBT — they live in `speculative_extensions/` and `research_tracks/`.

See `canonical/SCOPE.md` for the full inclusion/exclusion policy.

## What is NOT in canonical/

The following content has been intentionally moved out:

| Removed from canonical/ | Moved to |
|--------------------------|----------|
| `consciousness/psychons.tex` | `speculative_extensions/consciousness/` |
| `UBT_coding_fingerprint.tex` | `research_tracks/fingerprints/` |
| `UBT_spectral_parity_test.tex` | `research_tracks/fingerprints/` |
| `appendix_universe_as_atom.tex` | `speculative_extensions/cosmology_or_metaphysics/` |

Consciousness claims, dark-matter/dark-energy interpretive assertions beyond proved status, fingerprint/parity side-tracks, and universe-as-atom cosmological speculation are **not** part of canonical UBT.

## Bridges Directory

The `bridges/` subdirectory contains **navigation bridge files** — cross-reference-only documents that help an external reviewer traverse the repository without reading multiple scattered files. They contain no new derivations.

| Bridge file | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GR_chain_bridge.tex` | Locates each step of the GR recovery chain (Θ→g→Γ→R→Einstein) with proof-status labels |
| `QED_limit_bridge.tex` | Collects QED limit claims, running coupling derivation, and marks the B_base open problem explicitly |
| `gauge_emergence_bridge.tex` | Lists each gauge group component (SU(3), SU(2)_L, U(1)_Y) with proved / semi-empirical / open labels |

**When to use bridges vs. primary files:**
- Use **primary canonical files** (geometry/, interactions/, fields/) when you need the actual mathematical definition or derivation.
- Use **bridge files** when you need to understand which claims are proved, which are open, and where to find the proof.

## Principles

### 1. Single Definition Rule
Each concept has **exactly one** canonical definition in this directory. All other documents must reference or include from here.

### 2. Conflict Resolution
When multiple versions of a definition exist in the repository:
- The `canonical/` version is authoritative
- Conflicting versions should be marked as deprecated
- Legacy versions remain in `unified_biquaternion_theory/` (read-only)

### 3. Symbol Standardization
All symbols follow the dictionary in `CANONICAL_DEFINITIONS.md`:
- `α` = fine structure constant ONLY
- `ψ` = scalar imaginary time component ONLY  
- `χ, ξ` = vector imaginary time components ONLY
- `T_B` = biquaternion time (canonical)
- `τ` = complex time (isotropic limit/simplification)
- `q` = biquaternion coordinate ONLY
- etc.

### 4. Version Control
- All canonical files include version headers
- Changes require justification and documentation
- Backwards-incompatible changes trigger version increment

## Usage

### For Authors
When writing new UBT content:
1. Check `CANONICAL_DEFINITIONS.md` first
2. Use `\input{canonical/fields/theta_field.tex}` in LaTeX
3. Do NOT redefine canonical symbols
4. Report conflicts as issues
5. **Note**: Biquaternion time T_B is canonical; complex time τ is the isotropic limit

### For Consolidation
When consolidating existing content:
1. Compare against canonical definitions
2. Rewrite using canonical notation
3. Remove duplicate definitions
4. Update cross-references

### For Reviewers
When reviewing UBT documents:
1. Verify consistency with canonical definitions
2. Check symbol usage against dictionary
3. Ensure proper citations to canonical sources
4. Flag any redefinitions

## Status

### Canonical Tightening: ✅ Complete

- Fingerprint/parity files moved to `research_tracks/fingerprints/`
- `appendix_universe_as_atom.tex` moved to `speculative_extensions/cosmology_or_metaphysics/`
- CANONICAL_DEFINITIONS.md audited; speculative claims downgraded or relocated

### Core Definitions: ✅ Complete
- Theta field Θ(q,T_B)
- Biquaternion time T_B = t + iψ + jχ + kξ (canonical)
- Metric g_μν
- Connection Γ^λ_μν

## Notes

### DO NOT MODIFY
Files in `unified_biquaternion_theory/` are original research documents and should NOT be modified. They are preserved for historical reference.

### Consolidation Source
Most consolidated content comes from `consolidation_project/` which contains partial consolidations. The `canonical/` directory represents the final, authoritative versions.
