# Canonical UBT Directory

This directory contains the **canonical (authoritative)** versions of all Unified Biquaternion Theory definitions, derivations, and formulations.

## Purpose

The `canonical/` directory serves as the **single source of truth** for UBT to resolve conflicts and duplications found across the repository.

## Structure

```

## Principles

### 1. Single Definition Rule
Each concept has **exactly one** canonical definition in this directory. All other documents must reference or include from here.

### 2. Conflict Resolution
When multiple versions of a definition exist in the repository:
- The `canonical/` version is authoritative
- Conflicting versions should be marked as deprecated
- Legacy versions remain in `unified_biquaternion_theory/` (read-only)

### 3. Symbol Standardization
All symbols follow the dictionary in `CANONICAL_DEFINITIONS.md`:
- `α` = fine structure constant ONLY
- `ψ` = scalar imaginary time component ONLY  
- `χ, ξ` = vector imaginary time components ONLY
- `T_B` = biquaternion time (canonical)
- `τ` = complex time (isotropic limit/simplification)
- `q` = biquaternion coordinate ONLY
- etc.

### 4. Version Control
- All canonical files include version headers
- Changes require justification and documentation
- Backwards-incompatible changes trigger version increment

## Usage

### For Authors
When writing new UBT content:
1. Check `CANONICAL_DEFINITIONS.md` first
2. Use `\input{canonical/fields/theta_field.tex}` in LaTeX
3. Do NOT redefine canonical symbols
4. Report conflicts as issues
5. **Note**: Biquaternion time T_B is canonical; complex time τ is the isotropic limit

### For Consolidation
When consolidating existing content:
1. Compare against canonical definitions
2. Rewrite using canonical notation
3. Remove duplicate definitions
4. Update cross-references

### For Reviewers
When reviewing UBT documents:
1. Verify consistency with canonical definitions
2. Check symbol usage against dictionary
3. Ensure proper citations to canonical sources
4. Flag any redefinitions

## Status

## Notes

### DO NOT MODIFY
Files in `unified_biquaternion_theory/` are original research documents and should NOT be modified. They are preserved for historical reference.

### Consolidation Source
Most consolidated content comes from `consolidation_project/` which contains partial consolidations. The `canonical/` directory represents the final, authoritative versions.

### Research Extensions
Speculative or experimental content (holography, p-adic extensions, etc.) will be organized into `research_extensions/` directory (Phase 6).

## Questions?

For questions about canonical definitions:
1. Check `CANONICAL_DEFINITIONS.md`
2. Review `consolidation_project/metadata/consolidation_map.md`
3. Consult repository maintainers
