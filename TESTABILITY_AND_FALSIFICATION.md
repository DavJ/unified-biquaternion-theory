# Testability and Falsification Criteria for UBT

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define what observations would falsify UBT and specify experimental requirements

---

## Purpose of This Document

A scientific theory must be **falsifiable** - there must be observations that could prove it wrong. This document specifies:
1. What observations would falsify (disprove) UBT
2. What testable predictions UBT should make
3. Current gaps in testability
4. Path toward making UBT falsifiable

This is essential for scientific integrity and distinguishes UBT from unfalsifiable metaphysics.

---

## Current Testability Status: **INSUFFICIENT**

**Assessment:** UBT currently lacks specific, quantitative, testable predictions that distinguish it from established physics. Most claims are either:
- Too vague to test ("new particles exist")
- Identical to known physics (GR vacuum equations)
- Unfalsifiable (consciousness claims without parameters)

**Required Development:** Specify at least ONE concrete prediction with:
- Numerical value(s) and error estimates
- Experimental method to measure it
- Clear criterion for success/failure
- Comparison to Standard Model/GR predictions

---

## Falsification Criteria

### What Would Disprove UBT?

A theory is falsifiable if we can specify observations that would prove it wrong. For UBT:

#### 1. Fine-Structure Constant
**If proven true, would support UBT:**
- α⁻¹ remains close to 137 at all energy scales with small QED corrections

**If observed, would FALSIFY UBT:**
- α⁻¹ measured to be significantly different from 137 at any scale beyond QED running
- Example: If α⁻¹(M_Z) = 150 instead of ~128
- Or if running doesn't follow QED/QCD predictions

**Current Status:** Cannot falsify yet because:
- UBT hasn't specified exact α⁻¹ prediction at each scale
- Hasn't calculated quantum corrections rigorously
- No distinction from Standard Model predictions

**Required:** Calculate α⁻¹(μ) at multiple energy scales with error bars:
```
α⁻¹(m_e) = 137.036 ± [UBT uncertainty]
α⁻¹(M_Z) = 127.95 ± [UBT uncertainty]
α⁻¹(M_Planck) = [UBT prediction] ± [uncertainty]
```

#### 2. Gravitational Physics
**If observed, would FALSIFY UBT:**
- Deviations from GR predictions at ANY scale if UBT predicts exact GR
- OR: No deviations observed if UBT predicts specific deviations

**UBT must specify:**
- Does it predict EXACT GR, or modifications?
- If modifications, at what scales? (Solar system? Galactic? Cosmological?)
- What is the predicted perihelion precession (same as GR or different)?
- What are predicted gravitational wave forms (same as GR or different)?

**Example falsifiable prediction:**
```
Perihelion precession of Mercury:
GR predicts: 43.03" per century
UBT predicts: 43.03 + Δ where Δ = [value] ± [uncertainty]
If measured value differs from UBT by > 3σ → FALSIFIED
```

**Current Status:** No deviations from GR specified, so cannot test

#### 3. Particle Physics
**If observed, would FALSIFY UBT:**
- New particles predicted by UBT not found at specified energies
- Measured properties differ significantly from predictions

**UBT must predict:**
- Masses of any new particles beyond Standard Model
- Spin, charge, color quantum numbers
- Production cross-sections at LHC energies
- Decay modes and branching ratios
- Interaction strengths with SM particles

**Example falsifiable prediction:**
```
New scalar particle X:
Mass: m_X = 500 GeV ± 50 GeV
Spin: 0
Charge: neutral
Production: pp → X at σ = 10 pb at √s = 14 TeV
Decay: X → γγ with BR = 0.001
If LHC data rules out this parameter space → FALSIFIED
```

**Current Status:** No specific particle predictions made

#### 4. Dark Matter
**If observed, would FALSIFY UBT:**
- Dark matter properties inconsistent with UBT predictions

**UBT must predict:**
- Dark matter mass (or mass range)
- Interaction cross-section with normal matter
- Velocity distribution
- Density profile in galaxies
- Whether it's cold, warm, or hot dark matter
- Direct detection signature

**Example falsifiable prediction:**
```
Dark matter from UBT p-adic sector:
Mass: m_DM = 100 GeV ± 10 GeV
Cross-section: σ_SI = 10⁻⁴⁵ cm² (spin-independent)
Velocity: ⟨v⟩ = 220 km/s (cold)
Density profile: ρ(r) = ρ_0 / (1 + (r/r_s)²) with r_s = [value]
If direct detection experiments exclude this → FALSIFIED
```

**Current Status:** Only general p-adic proposals, no specific predictions

#### 5. Consciousness (Psychons)
**If observed, would FALSIFY psychon hypothesis:**
- Consciousness behaviors inconsistent with predictions
- Brain measurements don't show predicted signatures
- Anesthetic effects differ from predictions

**Psychon hypothesis must predict:**
- Psychon mass (or explain masslessness)
- Coupling constant to neural matter
- Observable EEG/MEG signatures
- Effects of anesthetics on psychon field
- Brain region specificity
- Consciousness threshold

**Example falsifiable prediction:**
```
Psychon oscillations in cortex:
Frequency: f_p = 40 Hz ± 5 Hz (gamma band)
Amplitude threshold: A_c = [value] μV in EEG
Coherence length: λ_c = 10 cm ± 2 cm across cortex
Anesthetic effect: propofol reduces A by factor of 10
If measurements show no such correlation → FALSIFIED
```

**Current Status:** Completely unfalsifiable - no parameters specified

#### 6. Complex Time Observability
**If observed, would FALSIFY complex time:**
- No observable effects of imaginary time ψ at any scale

**UBT must specify:**
- How ψ could be observed (what experiment?)
- At what energy/length scale does ψ become important?
- What phenomena require ψ vs being explainable by real time alone?

**Example falsifiable prediction:**
```
Imaginary time effects in high-energy collisions:
At E > E_critical = 1 TeV:
- Phase shifts in scattering: δψ = [formula]
- Observable in angular distributions
- Specific deviation from SM prediction
If no deviation observed → complex time irrelevant or falsified
```

**Current Status:** No observability mechanism specified

#### 7. Multiverse Structure
**If observed, would FALSIFY multiverse interpretation:**
- Evidence that contradicts multiple universe branches
- Inability to explain quantum superposition via branches

**UBT must specify:**
- How many branches? (Continuous? Discrete? Growing?)
- Can branches be observed/detected?
- Does branching occur? If so, when?
- How does this differ from Many-Worlds Interpretation?
- Any testable predictions distinguishing from single-universe theories?

**Current Status:** Philosophical interpretation, no testable predictions

## What UBT SHOULD Predict (But Currently Doesn't)

### Category A: Numerical Values with Error Bars

Every dimensionless number in physics should ideally be calculable. UBT should predict:

1. **Coupling Constants:**
   - α⁻¹ = [predicted value] ± [uncertainty] at each energy scale
   - α_s(M_Z) = [predicted value] ± [uncertainty]
   - g_weak/g_strong ratio

2. **Mass Ratios:**
   - m_μ/m_e = [predicted value] ± [uncertainty]
   - m_τ/m_μ = [predicted value] ± [uncertainty]
   - m_top/m_bottom = [predicted value] ± [uncertainty]

3. **Mixing Angles:**
   - θ_12, θ_23, θ_13 (CKM matrix elements)
   - Neutrino mixing angles

4. **Cosmological Parameters:**
   - Ω_DM (dark matter density) = [predicted value]
   - Ω_Λ (dark energy density) = [predicted value]
   - w (dark energy equation of state) = [predicted value]

**Why this matters:** These are measured to high precision. A theory that calculates them from first principles would be revolutionary.

**Current UBT status:** Only α is addressed, and that derivation is incomplete.

### Category B: Observable Deviations from Standard Physics

UBT should specify where it differs from SM/GR and by how much:

1. **Modified GR:**
   - Δ(perihelion precession) = [value]
   - Δ(gravitational lensing) = [value]
   - Δ(gravitational waves) = [waveform difference]

2. **Modified QED:**
   - Δ(g-2)_electron = [value] beyond SM
   - Δ(Lamb shift) = [value]

3. **New Phenomena:**
   - Energy scale where new effects appear: E_new = [value]
   - Signatures in colliders
   - Cosmic ray effects

**Why this matters:** If UBT is identical to SM/GR everywhere we can test, it's unfalsifiable.

**Current UBT status:** No deviations specified.

### Category C: Experimental Signatures

UBT should describe observable signals in specific experiments:

1. **Collider Physics:**
   - LHC signatures (new particles, modified cross-sections)
   - Future collider predictions

2. **Precision Measurements:**
   - Atomic physics (hyperfine structure, etc.)
   - Muon g-2 anomaly explanation

3. **Astrophysics:**
   - Pulsar timing
   - Black hole shadows
   - Neutron star equations of state

4. **Cosmology:**
   - CMB anisotropies
   - Large-scale structure
   - Primordial nucleosynthesis

5. **Consciousness (if claims are maintained):**
   - EEG/MEG signals
   - fMRI BOLD responses
   - Anesthetic effects
   - Brain lesion predictions

**Why this matters:** Specific experimental signatures allow direct testing.

**Current UBT status:** No specific signatures calculated.

## Experimental Requirements for Testing UBT

### Near-Term Tests (Current Technology)

**If UBT made specific predictions, these experiments could test them:**

1. **Precision α Measurements:**
   - Measure α at different energies (possible with current accelerators)
   - Compare to UBT predictions vs SM running

2. **Gravitational Observations:**
   - Pulsar timing (ns accuracy)

4. **Neuroscience (for consciousness claims):**
   - High-density EEG (available now)
   - 7T fMRI (available at research institutions)
   - Two-photon microscopy (single neuron resolution)
   - Anesthetic studies (standard neuroscience)

**Required from UBT:** Specific numerical predictions for these measurements.

### Future Tests (Decade+ Timescale)

**If UBT survives near-term tests and makes appropriate predictions:**

1. **Future Colliders:**
   - FCC (100 TeV) - could probe higher energies
   - Muon collider - cleaner environment than proton colliders
   - Linear colliders - precision measurements

2. **Space-Based Detectors:**
   - LISA (space gravitational wave detector) - launch 2030s
   - Next-generation CMB satellites
   - Dark matter satellites

3. **Quantum Gravity Tests:**
   - Planck-scale tests (extremely challenging)
   - Quantum gravity phenomenology
   - Tabletop quantum gravity experiments (if predictions exist)

4. **Advanced Neuroscience:**
   - Whole-brain recording (long-term goal)
   - Quantum effects in neurons (if relevant)
   - Consciousness measurement technology (if developed)

**Required from UBT:** Predictions at these scales.

## How to Make UBT Falsifiable - Concrete Steps

### Step 1: Choose ONE Specific Prediction

**Pick the most promising direction:**

Option A: **Modified GR Prediction**
- Calculate specific correction to perihelion precession
- Compare to Solar system data
- Timeline: Could be tested now if prediction exists

Option B: **New Particle Prediction**
- Specify mass, charge, spin of one new particle
- Calculate LHC production rate
- Timeline: LHC data could test within years

Option C: **Dark Matter Property**
- Predict specific direct detection cross-section
- Timeline: Ongoing experiments could test

Option D: **Consciousness Signature**
- Predict specific EEG pattern
- Design neuroscience experiment
- Timeline: Years to decades

**Recommendation:** Start with option A or B (physics) as these are more tractable than D (consciousness).

### Step 2: Calculate Completely

**For chosen prediction, calculate:**
1. Central value (with all assumptions stated)
2. Theoretical uncertainty (from UBT formalism)
3. Comparison to Standard Model/GR prediction
4. Required experimental precision to distinguish
5. All intermediate steps with full derivations

**Output should be publishable calculation** in peer-reviewed journal.

### Step 3: Specify Experimental Test

**Define exactly:**
1. What experiment can measure this?
2. What precision is needed?
3. Is this achievable with current technology?
4. If not, when will technology be ready?
5. What background effects could mimic signal?
6. How to distinguish signal from background?

### Step 4: State Success/Failure Criteria

**Be explicit:**
- If measurement gives [range], UBT is supported
- If measurement gives [different range], UBT is falsified
- If error bars too large, test is inconclusive

**Example:**
```
UBT predicts: X = 42.0 ± 0.5 (theoretical uncertainty)
SM predicts: X = 40.0 ± 0.1
Experiment measures: X = 41.5 ± 0.2

Result interpretation:
- If 41.5 ± 0.2 includes 42.0: Consistent with UBT, inconsistent with SM
- If 41.5 ± 0.2 excludes 42.0: UBT falsified
- If error bars ±1.0: Inconclusive, need better experiment
```

### Step 5: Conduct (or Propose) Experiment

**Paths forward:**
1. Use existing data (analyze publicly available datasets)
2. Propose new analysis of existing experiments
3. Propose new experiment (requires collaboration, funding)
4. Wait for upcoming experiments to report results

## Current Gaps and Required Work

### Critical Gaps:

1. **No Quantitative Predictions**
   - Gap: UBT makes qualitative claims but no numbers
   - Required: Calculate at least one numerical prediction

2. **No Distinction from Standard Physics**
   - Gap: Where UBT differs from SM/GR not specified
   - Required: Identify regime where UBT ≠ SM/GR

3. **Unfalsifiable Consciousness Claims**
   - Gap: Psychons have no specified properties
   - Required: Either make testable or remove claims

4. **Vague "New Particles"**
   - Gap: "Theory predicts new particles" without specifics
   - Required: Masses, quantum numbers, interactions

5. **No Error Analysis**
   - Gap: No uncertainty estimates on any claims
   - Required: Theoretical error bars on all predictions

## Ethical Responsibility

### Why Falsifiability Matters:

1. **Scientific Integrity**: Unfalsifiable claims are not science
2. **Public Trust**: People deserve honest assessment of what's tested
3. **Resource Allocation**: Time/money should go to testable ideas
4. **Intellectual Honesty**: Acknowledge when claims aren't testable yet

### Commitments:

1. **Transparency**: Clearly state what is testable vs untestable
2. **Honesty**: Don't claim predictions that are actually postdictions
3. **Humility**: Acknowledge when theory can't yet make testable predictions
4. **Development**: Work toward making theory falsifiable

---

## Conclusion

**Current Status:** UBT is **NOT falsifiable** in its present form because it lacks specific, quantitative, testable predictions that distinguish it from established physics.

**Path Forward:**
1. Choose ONE specific prediction
2. Calculate it rigorously with error estimates
3. Specify experimental test with success/failure criteria
4. Conduct or await experiment
5. Revise theory based on results

**Timeline:** Years of development needed before falsifiability is achieved.

**Commitment:** Future UBT work will prioritize developing falsifiable predictions over making additional untestable claims.

**Key Message:** Admitting current non-falsifiability is honest and necessary. What matters is working systematically toward falsifiable status.
