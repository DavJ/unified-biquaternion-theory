# Fundamental Objects

The mathematical foundation of UBT is the **biquaternion algebra** ℂ⊗ℍ and its
associated structures.

## The Biquaternion Algebra ℂ⊗ℍ

A **biquaternion** is an element of ℂ⊗ℍ — the tensor product of complex numbers with
the quaternion algebra. Concretely:

```
q = a + bi + cj + dk,   a,b,c,d ∈ ℂ
```

Key algebraic fact: **ℂ⊗ℍ ≅ Mat(2,ℂ)** — the algebra of 2×2 complex matrices.
This isomorphism is the structural bridge to the Standard Model.

## Complex Time T_B

UBT extends real time to **biquaternion time**:

```
T_B = t + iψ + jχ + kξ
```

where t is real time and ψ, χ, ξ are imaginary components. In the main physical
sector only τ = t + iψ is active (two-component complex time).

## Involutions and Z₂×Z₂×Z₂

The imaginary quaternion subspace Im(ℍ) = span{i, j, k} admits three involutions
P_I, P_J, P_K that form a Z₂×Z₂×Z₂ group. This structure forces SU(3)_c with
zero free parameters (dim Im(ℍ) = 3 is the key constraint).

## Automorphism Group

```
Aut(ℂ⊗ℍ) ≅ [GL(2,ℂ) × GL(2,ℂ)] / ℤ₂
```

The left and right actions of this group on Θ give rise to the electroweak and
color gauge symmetries.  
Status: **Proved [L0]**
