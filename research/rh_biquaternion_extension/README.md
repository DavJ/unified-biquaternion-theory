# Riemann Hypothesis and Biquaternion Extension

## ⚠️ Research Status: Speculative

This directory contains **exploratory research** on potential connections between the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) spectral structure and the Riemann zeta function. 

**Important Disclaimer:** 
- The content in this directory is **speculative and exploratory**
- UBT does **not claim to prove the Riemann Hypothesis**
- The connections described are **structural analogies**, not rigorous proofs
- This material is separated from the core UBT theory to maintain scientific integrity

## Purpose

The biquaternionic spectral operator \(M_{BQ}\) defined in UBT has interesting mathematical properties that may relate to number theory:

1. **Spectral Projection**: The complex projection of \(M_{BQ}\)'s real spectrum resembles the structure of the Riemann zeta zeros
2. **Zeta Regularization**: Standard QFT techniques using ζ(s) appear naturally in UBT calculations
3. **Prime Selection**: The derivation of α⁻¹ = 137 involves prime number properties
4. **p-adic Extensions**: The adelic framework connects to number-theoretic structures

## Research vs. Core Theory

### Core UBT (scientifically grounded):
- Biquaternionic field equations
- Complex time formulation
- Spectral operator definitions
- Mathematical consistency of the framework

### Speculative Extensions (exploratory):
- Claims about proving or disproving the Riemann Hypothesis
- Direct identification of UBT eigenvalues with zeta zeros
- Number-theoretic conjectures based on UBT structure

## Contents

- `RH_Spectral_Link.md` - Overview of structural connections (moved from root)
- Future numerical studies and computational explorations may be added here

## Future Work

Potential research directions (all speculative):
1. Numerical studies comparing \(M_{BQ}\) eigenvalues to zeta zeros
2. Lattice simulations in complex time
3. Random matrix theory comparisons
4. p-adic QFT calculations
