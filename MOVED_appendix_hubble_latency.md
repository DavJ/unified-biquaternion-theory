# ⚠️ CONTENT MOVED

**This file has been relocated as of January 2026.**

The Hubble Latency appendix content has been moved to the **Research Front** layer.

**New Location:** [research_front/hubble_latency/appendix_hubble_latency.md](research_front/hubble_latency/appendix_hubble_latency.md)

**Why?** The Hubble Latency hypothesis is an exploratory research hypothesis (Layer C), not part of Core UBT.
