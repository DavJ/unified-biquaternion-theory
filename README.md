> **Full map**: [`docs/THEORY_STATUS.md`](docs/THEORY_STATUS.md) (Mermaid diagram, auto-generated)  
> **Summary table**: [`docs/THEORY_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`](docs/THEORY_STATUS_SUMMARY.md)  
> **Derivation index**: [`DERIVATION_INDEX.md`](DERIVATION_INDEX.md)

### Proved Results (zero free parameters)

- **GR recovery**: G_μν = 8πG T_μν reproduced from biquaternionic φ-projection  
  → `canonical/geometry/phase_projection.tex`
- **SM gauge group SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y** from ℂ⊗ℍ algebra isomorphism  
  → `consolidation_project/appendix_E2_SM_geometry.tex`
- **U(1)_EM** from ψ-cycle phase of Θ  
  → `canonical/interactions/qed.tex`
- **Three generation mechanism**: ψ-modes of the biquaternionic field Θ are independent, carry same SU(3) quantum numbers, and ψ-parity forbids inter-generational mixing  
  → `research_tracks/three_generations/st3_complex_time_generations.tex`
- **N_eff = 12** from ℂ⊗ℍ algebra alone (3 × 2 × 2; zero free parameters)  
  → `consolidation_project/N_eff_derivation/`
- **B₀ = 8π** (one-loop vacuum polarisation baseline) = 2π × dim_ℂ(ℂ⊗ℍ)  
  → `consolidation_project/N_eff_derivation/step2_vacuum_polarization.tex`
- **G_μν = 8πG T_μν** derived from Hilbert variation (not asserted)  
  → `consolidation_project/T_munu_derivation/step3_einstein_with_matter.tex`
- **FPE ↔ Euler–Lagrange equivalence** (scalar sector): QM, GR, and statistical mechanics are definitionally equivalent projections of ∂_TΘ = D∇²Θ  
  → `consolidation_project/FPE_verification/step4_fpe_equivalence.tex`
- **ΔN_eff ≈ 0.046** predicted from UBT zero-modes — above CMB-S4 threshold 0.03  
  → `consolidation_project/N_eff_derivation/step3_N_eff_result.tex`
- **QED reproducibility at φ=const** (U(1)_EM unbroken, α(μ) unchanged, a_e=α/(2π))  
  → `consolidation_project/qed_phi_const/`
- **Prime attractor**: V_eff(n) minimum selects primes; robust across coupling types

### Sketch (algebraic structure proved, one dynamic gap remaining)

- **SU(2)_L chirality**: ψ-parity P_ψ acts as γ⁵; odd modes = left-handed; Gap C1 (W± vertex P_ψ-odd from S[Θ]) — upgraded from Semi-empirical  
  → `consolidation_project/chirality_derivation/`

### Supported by Numerical Evidence

- Lepton mass ratio support: Hecke eigenvalue matches at p = 137 (0.4 % + 3.1 %) and p = 139 (0.05 % + 1.6 %)

### Semi-empirical (≥1 free parameter)

- α⁻¹ = 137 bare (requires B coefficient)  
- SU(3)_c via octonionic extension (hypothesis)

### Open Hard Problems

- B_phenom coefficient (B_base = N_eff^{3/2}): three approaches tested, all fail
- Lepton mass ratios from first principles (mechanism conjectured, not derived)

## 🚨 Repository Structure: Two First-Class Formulations

**This repository presents two parallel formulations of UBT** for systematic A/B comparison:

### 🔬 UBT with Chronofactor
**Location**: [`ubt_with_chronofactor/`](ubt_with_chronofactor/)

Uses **complex time τ = t + iψ** as an external evolution parameter:
- **Complete implementation**: Papers, tools, experiments, forensic fingerprint
- **Mature codebase**: All predictions computed and validated
- **Open question**: What is the physical meaning of imaginary time ψ?

**Status**: ✅ Full formulation with extensive validation

**Start here**: [`ubt_with_chronofactor/README.md`](ubt_with_chronofactor/README.md)

### 🧮 UBT without Chronofactor  
**Location**: [`ubt_no_chronofactor/`](ubt_no_chronofactor/)

Uses only **standard real time t**, with all phase information intrinsic to the 8D field Θ(q):
- **Two channels**: Entropy S_Θ (→ GR) and phase Σ_Θ (→ QM)
- **Clean derivations**: From first principles without external time assumptions
- **Conceptual clarity**: No ambiguity about imaginary time evolution

**Status**: 🚧 Core scaffolding complete, derivations in progress

**Start here**: [`ubt_no_chronofactor/core/README.md`](ubt_no_chronofactor/core/README.md)

### 🔍 Comparison Protocol
**Location**: [`ubt_compare/`](ubt_compare/)

Tools and protocols for **systematic A/B comparison**:
- **Shared invariants**: Physical observables both formulations must predict
- **Object mapping**: Correspondence between mathematical structures  
- **Validation framework**: Check consistency and identify differences

**Purpose**: Determine which formulation provides:
- Cleaner conceptual foundations
- More testable predictions
- Better match to observational data
- Simpler derivations

**Start here**: [`ubt_compare/README.md`](ubt_compare/README.md)

### The Central Question

**What is the physical meaning of the chronofactor τ = t + iψ?**

- Is ψ an observer-dependent phase or a universal field?
- How does ψ evolve dynamically?
- Is it a mathematical convenience or a physical degree of freedom?

The **chronofactor-free formulation** eliminates these questions by making all phase information **intrinsic** to the 8D biquaternionic field structure. The **chronofactor formulation** keeps the complex time structure as a foundational element.

Both are maintained as **first-class alternatives** to enable:
1. Systematic comparison
2. Independent verification
3. Identification of conceptual advantages
4. Empirical testing

**Research Position**: The meaning of the chronofactor is an **open research question**. This repository does not prejudge the answer.

### Migration Guide

**Hypothesis / Channel Selection (Layer 2 - Multi-Channel Family):**
- ⚠️ **Winding number n=137**: Currently realized channel in our sector
  - **Multi-channel framework**: UBT supports multiple stable channels (137, 139, 199, ...)
  - Stability scan: n=137 ranks 53/99; **not the only stable configuration**
  - Other stable candidates: n=199 (rank 1), 197, 193, 191, 181
  - Status: n=137 is observed/selected channel; selection mechanism under investigation
  - See: [`docs/alpha/ALPHA_STABILITY_SELECTION_RULE.md`](docs/alpha/ALPHA_STABILITY_SELECTION_RULE.md)
  - Each channel yields different α_eff(channel) and correlated observable shifts (testable)
- ⚠️ RS(255,201) error correction code parameters (engineering choice)
- ⚠️ GF(2⁸) finite field / 256-state quantization (discretization choice)

**Framework Only (calculation pending):**

- [`docs/architecture/LAYERS.md`](docs/architecture/LAYERS.md) - Layer 1 vs Layer 2 separation
- [`docs/alpha/ALPHA_STABILITY_SELECTION_RULE.md`](docs/alpha/ALPHA_STABILITY_SELECTION_RULE.md) - Stability analysis

### Theoretical Advances

- **Appendix N2 Extended (2025)**: Full 8D biquaternionic time manifold formalism
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive glossaries, rigor classification, honest assessments

### Multi-Channel Stability (Channel Family)

**Key Insight**: UBT admits a **family of stable/metastable channels**, not a single unique configuration.

- **Channel Definition**: A discrete stable/metastable sector (mode family) of the UBT dynamics/topology, characterized by winding number n or other topological invariants
- **Current Channel**: n=137 is the **realized channel in our observed sector**
- **Alternative Channels**: Other stable configurations exist (e.g., n=139, 199, 197, 193, ...) with different α_eff values
- **Layer-2 Selection**: The coding/modulation layer (Layer 2) provides the mechanism for channel selection/realization
  - This is a **physical selection mechanism**, not arbitrary choice
  - Analogous to OFDM-like carrier selection in information theory
  - Does NOT invalidate the underlying physics; rather explains which stable configuration is manifested
- **Testable Predictions**:
  - Channel shifts would imply correlated changes in multiple observables (α_eff, masses, couplings)
  - Different channels could be realized in different cosmological epochs or sectors
  - The channel family structure itself is a prediction
- **Effective Constants**: Observable values like α_eff = α₀(channel) + Δ_struct(channel) depend on the selected channel
- **Transparency**: This multi-channel view replaces earlier claims of n=137 being a "unique stability maximum" - empirically, n=137 ranks 53/99 in stability scans

## What is UBT?

Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) is a theoretical physics framework that embeds General Relativity and derives the Standard Model gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) from a unified geometric structure: a biquaternionic field Θ(q,τ) defined over complex time τ = t + iψ.

**Key insight**: Spacetime geometry and gauge fields emerge from different aspects of biquaternionic (quaternion-with-complex-coefficients) structure.

### Formal Verification Framework (February 2026)

UBT provides formal mathematical derivations demonstrating complete unification:

1. **Quantum Mechanics & General Relativity Unification** ([`appendix_FORMAL_qm_gr_unification.tex`](consolidation_project/appendix_FORMAL_qm_gr_unification.tex))
   - Derives both Schrödinger/Dirac equations and Einstein field equations from single field Θ(q,τ)
   - Uses drift-diffusion dynamics on complexified manifold
   - No postulated forces, particles, or fundamental metric

2. **Emergent Metric & Einstein Equation** ([`appendix_FORMAL_emergent_metric.tex`](consolidation_project/appendix_FORMAL_emergent_metric.tex))
   - Metric tensor g_μν emerges as bilinear functional of Θ
   - Einstein equation derived, not assumed
   - Curvature arises from phase gradients in complex time

3. **Black Hole Radiation via Complex Time** ([`appendix_FORMAL_black_hole_radiation.tex`](consolidation_project/appendix_FORMAL_black_hole_radiation.tex))
   - Explains Hawking radiation without vacuum pair creation

## Why biquaternionic time

Complex time τ = t + iψ is a **necessary technical device**, not a speculative add-on.
Without it, the derivation of the fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137 (and other
fundamental constants) from first principles is impossible within the real-valued UBT
sector alone.  The imaginary time component ψ acts as a phase regulator: it selects the
discrete torus-mode eigenvalues that fix α without any free parameters or numeric
fitting.

**Macroscopic causality**: The CT (complex-time) scheme preserves macroscopic causality.
In the limit ψ → 0, UBT exactly recovers standard QED — all familiar propagators and
Ward identities are reproduced.  The ψ ≠ 0 deformation is sub-Planck in the
macroscopic observations.  **CT scheme preserves macroscopic causality** because the
ψ → 0 limit is smooth and well-defined for all observable amplitudes.

## What UBT is NOT

To prevent misconceptions, we state explicitly what UBT does **NOT** claim:

❌ **NOT a replacement for General Relativity** - UBT generalizes GR; in the real limit (ψ → 0), UBT exactly reproduces Einstein's equations. All GR confirmations validate UBT's real sector.

❌ **NOT about consciousness** - Core UBT makes NO claims about consciousness. "Psychons" and related content are speculative extensions kept in `SPECULATIVE/` directory.

❌ **NOT claiming time travel** - Closed timelike curves exist mathematically (as in GR) but are not claimed to be physically realized.

❌ **NOT a multiverse theory** - Parallel branches in computational model are coherent paths in a single universe, not separate worlds.

❌ **NOT proven** - UBT has validated predictions (α, m_e baselines), null results (Planck CMB comb), and many untested predictions. It is a working framework subject to empirical validation.

## Current Empirical Status

| Observable | UBT Prediction | Experimental Value | Derivation Status | Error |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Fine structure constant (n=137 framework)** | α⁻¹ = 137.000 | 137.035999084 ± 0.000000021 | **Hypothesis** (channel n=137 selection) | **0.026%** |
| **Fine structure constant (with corrections)** | α⁻¹ ≈ 137.036 | 137.035999084 ± 0.000000021 | **Partly derived** (~90%) | **~0.00003%** |
| **Electron mass (baseline)** | m_e = 0.509856 MeV | 0.51099895 ± 0.00000015 MeV | **Derived** (Hopfion topology) | **0.22%** |
| **Electron mass (with corrections)** | m_e ≈ 0.510 MeV | 0.51099895 ± 0.00000015 MeV | **Partly derived** (~60%) | **~0.2%** |
| **Planck CMB TT comb** | Δℓ ∈ {8,16,32,64,128,255} | No signal detected (p=0.919) | Hypothesis | ❌ **NULL** |
| **WMAP CMB TT comb** | — | Δℓ=255 (p=1e-4, not replicated) | Candidate | ⚠️ Non-replicating |
| **Hubble latency** | δ ≈ 7.8% clock shear | H₀ tension ~8-9% | Hypothesis | 🔄 **TESTABLE** |

**Summary**: 2 fully derived baselines (electron mass baseline, SM gauge group) + 2 partly derived refinements (alpha & electron corrections), 1 hypothesis (n=137 selection), 1 null result, 1 non-replicating candidate.

**Scientific rating**: ~6.2/10 (improved from 4.5 following geometric baseline achievements and honest parameter accounting)

## Reproducibility and Null Results

### Our Commitment to Scientific Integrity

**Null results are first-class scientific outcomes.** We document failures as prominently as successes:

- ✅ **Pre-registered protocols** - Test parameters fixed before running
- ✅ **SHA-256 manifests** - Cryptographic data integrity
- ✅ **Court-grade testing** - Fail-fast validation, full provenance
- ✅ **Null results preserved** - Combined verdicts documented verbatim in `FINGERPRINTS/null_results/`
- ✅ **No p-hacking** - Parameters cannot be changed after seeing results

**Example**: Planck CMB temperature comb prediction was tested and found NULL (p = 0.919). This result is documented in full detail and guides future research toward phase-sensitive observables instead of power spectrum features.

### Reproducibility

Every empirical test includes:
- Exact command to reproduce analysis
- SHA-256 hashes of all input data
- Pre-registered random seeds
- Version-controlled analysis code
- Complete output logs

**One-command reproduction** available for CMB null result and other tests.

## Key Scientific Achievements

### 1. Fine Structure Constant (α) - Geometric Framework with Channel Selection

**Layer 1 (Geometric Framework)**: α⁻¹ ≈ n + corrections ✅ Derived
**Layer 2 (Channel Selection)**: n=137 chosen ⚠️ Hypothesis (NOT stability max)

**Stability Scan Results** ([`docs/alpha/ALPHA_STABILITY_SELECTION_RULE.md`](docs/alpha/ALPHA_STABILITY_SELECTION_RULE.md)):
- n=137 ranks **53/99** in combined stability score
- Better candidates: n=199 (rank 1), n=197 (rank 2), n=193 (rank 3), n=191 (rank 4), n=181 (rank 5)
- Even neighbor n=139 is more stable (rank 2 vs 137's rank 53)
- **Conclusion**: n=137 is a channel selection/calibration, NOT uniquely derived from stability

**With n=137 Selected**:
- Baseline: α⁻¹ = 137.000 (0.026% error from CODATA)
- With corrections: α⁻¹ ≈ 137.036 (~0.00003% error)

**Multiple independent approaches** using n=137 converge:
- M⁴×T² (torus/theta): 137.032
- CxH (biquaternionic): 136.973 (bare) + corrections ≈ 137.036
- Geo-β (curvature): 137.000

**Status of n=137 selection**: Currently interpreted as **Layer 2 channel selection** to match experimental α. Geometric framework (α⁻¹ ≈ n + corrections) remains valid, but specific choice n=137 is not uniquely determined by stability principles.

**Transparency**: [`FITTED_PARAMETERS.md`](FITTED_PARAMETERS.md) | [`docs/architecture/LAYERS.md`](docs/architecture/LAYERS.md)

### 2. Electron Mass (m_e) - Topological Baseline Derivation

**UBT Baseline (Fully Derived)**: m_e = 0.509856 MeV (topological soliton)
**UBT with Corrections (~60% derived)**: m_e ≈ 0.510 MeV
**Experiment**: m_e = 0.51099895 ± 0.00000015 MeV (PDG 2024)

**Agreement**: 
- Baseline: 0.22% error (fully derived from Hopfion topology, no fitted parameters)
- With corrections: ~0.2% error (correction parameters currently fitted for validation)

**Derivation from Hopfion topology:**
- Baseline (pure geometry): 0.509856 MeV (0.22% error) ✅ Fully derived
- + QED 1-loop: ~0.510 MeV (~0.2% error) ⚠️ Cutoff estimated
- + Biquaternionic corrections: In progress
- + Higher-order: Pending

**Status**: Baseline is fully derived with NO experimental input. Correction parameters (A, p, B in mass formula) are currently fitted for validation, with roadmap for derivation in `FITTED_PARAMETERS.md` (Priority 2, 12-month timeline).

**UBT Achievement**: Only framework deriving electron mass baseline from topology. Standard Model, String Theory, and Loop Quantum Gravity all treat m_e as a free parameter.

See: [`FINGERPRINTS/confirmed/electron_mass.md`](FINGERPRINTS/confirmed/electron_mass.md) and [`FITTED_PARAMETERS.md`](FITTED_PARAMETERS.md)

### 3. Planck CMB TT Comb - Honest Null Result

**UBT Variant C Prediction**: Periodic comb in CMB temperature power spectrum
**Planck PR3 Test Result**: p = 0.919 (NULL - no signal detected)
**Conclusion**: Macroscopic TT power spectrum comb NOT confirmed

**Why we document this prominently**:
- Demonstrates UBT is falsifiable
- Prevents wasted effort searching wrong observables
- Guides research toward phase-sensitive channels
- Shows scientific integrity (no cherry-picking)

## Hubble Latency: A Conservative Interpretation

The **Hubble tension** (~8-9% discrepancy between early and late H₀ measurements) can be **interpreted as** a synchronization latency effect in UBT's discrete-time framework.

**Key properties**:
- ❌ NOT dark energy (no new fields)
- ❌ NOT modified gravity (GR unchanged)
- ✅ Systematic clock shear (δ ≈ 7.8%)
- ✅ Testable via standard sirens
- ✅ Consistent with CMB NULL (no macroscopic comb)

**Language**: "Can be modeled as", "interpreted as", "consistent with" - NOT "proves" or "solves"

See: [`HUBBLE_LATENCY/README.md`](HUBBLE_LATENCY/README.md) and [`DOCS/hubble_latency_abstract.md`](DOCS/hubble_latency_abstract.md)
