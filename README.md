‚ö†Ô∏è **RESEARCH FRAMEWORK IN DEVELOPMENT** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT)** is a speculative theoretical framework exploring novel mathematical approaches to unifying physics. It combines concepts from **General Relativity**, **Quantum Field Theory**, and the **Standard Model symmetries** within a **biquaternionic field** defined over complex time \(\tau = t + i \psi\). The **Complex Consciousness Theory (CCT)** applies UBT principles to model consciousness as a physical phenomenon.

**Important:** UBT is currently in early-stage development and should NOT be considered a validated scientific theory. See [Scientific Status Document](UBT_SCIENTIFIC_STATUS_AND_DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed assessment of current limitations and future development requirements.

## üìú Overview

### Core Physics (Partially Developed)
- **Mathematical foundation**: biquaternion algebra, complex-time manifolds, covariant derivatives
- **Gravitation**: recovery of Einstein vacuum equations in real limit (matter coupling incomplete)
- **Gauge fields**: Standard Model gauge group SU(3) √ó SU(2) √ó U(1) embedded (not derived)
- **Electromagnetism** in curved space, including standing modulated EM field configurations
- **QED/QCD**: reformulation in UBT variables (quantization procedure incomplete)

### Speculative Extensions (Require Significant Development)
- **Fine-structure constant**: Multiple approaches suggest Œ±‚Åª¬π ‚âà 137, but ab initio derivation remains an open challenge
- **Dark sector physics**: p-adic extension proposals for dark matter/energy (detailed calculations incomplete)
- **Multiverse interpretation**: 32D structure as multiple universe branches, 4D projection mechanism needs formalization

### Highly Speculative (Philosophical Hypotheses)
- **Psychons**: hypothetical quanta of consciousness (no neuroscientific grounding, unfalsifiable in current form)
- **Closed Timelike Curves**: time-travel solutions (likely unphysical)
- **Consciousness experiments**: Theta Resonator concept (requires testable parameters)

## üìú Origin & Development

The **Unified Biquaternion Theory** was developed first as a general physical framework.  
During its formulation, a parallel line of work led to the **Complex Consciousness Theory**, which applies UBT principles in a simplified mathematical form to model consciousness as a physical phenomenon.  
This repository contains both the full UBT documents and the CCT application, along with appendices and experimental proposals.
