# Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT)

**Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT)** is the original and central framework of this project.  
It is a unified physical theory combining **General Relativity**, **Quantum Field Theory**, and the **Standard Model symmetries** within a **biquaternionic field** defined over complex time \(\tau = t + i \psi\).  
From its mathematical structure, the **Complex Consciousness Theory (CCT)** emerged as a specialized application focusing on cognitive processes and consciousness modeling.

## ðŸ“œ Overview

- **Mathematical foundation**: biquaternion algebra, complex-time manifolds, covariant derivatives.
- **Gravitation**: derivation of the metric tensor from biquaternion fields.
- **Gauge fields**: embedding of \(SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)\) into the UBT framework.
- **Electromagnetism** in curved space, including standing modulated EM field configurations.
- **Quantum electrodynamics (QED)** and **quantum chromodynamics (QCD)** reformulated in UBT variables.
- **Dark sector physics**: unified treatment of dark matter and dark energy via padic extensions.
- **Psychons**: quantum excitations of consciousness within the complex-time phase space.
- **Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)**: geometric and physical conditions for time-travel solutions.
- **Experimental concepts**: Theta Resonator for detecting persistent consciousness fields.
- **Complex Consciousness Theory (CCT)**: simplified, application-oriented formulation for modeling consciousness and cognitive phase transitions.

## ðŸ“œ Origin & Development

The **Unified Biquaternion Theory** was developed first as a general physical framework.  
During its formulation, a parallel line of work led to the **Complex Consciousness Theory**, which applies UBT principles in a simplified mathematical form to model consciousness as a physical phenomenon.  
This repository contains both the full UBT documents and the CCT application, along with appendices and experimental proposals.
