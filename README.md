**Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT)** is the original and central framework of this project.  
It is a unified physical theory that **generalizes Einstein's General Relativity** by combining it with **Quantum Field Theory** and the **Standard Model symmetries** within a **biquaternionic field** defined over complex time \(\tau = t + i \psi\). In the real-valued limit, UBT exactly recovers Einstein's field equations, ensuring full compatibility with GR while extending it through additional degrees of freedom that may correspond to dark sector physics and quantum gravitational corrections.  
From its mathematical structure, the **Complex Consciousness Theory (CCT)** emerged as a specialized application focusing on cognitive processes and consciousness modeling.

## üìú Overview

UBT **generalizes Einstein's General Relativity** by embedding it within a biquaternionic field defined over complex time. In the real-valued limit, UBT exactly reproduces Einstein's field equations, ensuring full compatibility with all experimental confirmations of GR while extending the framework through additional degrees of freedom.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Theory Status**
- UBT is a **research framework in development**, not a validated scientific theory
- Mathematical foundations are incomplete (see documentation below)
- Fine-structure constant work is postulation, not derivation
- Consciousness claims are highly speculative without neuroscientific grounding
- **See [Reading Guide](UBT_READING_GUIDE.md) for how to navigate the theory responsibly**

Key features:
- **Mathematical foundation**: biquaternion algebra, complex-time manifolds, covariant derivatives.
- **General Relativity compatibility**: Full recovery of Einstein's equations in the real limit (see Appendix R).
- **Gravitation**: derivation of the metric tensor from biquaternion fields.
- **Gauge fields**: embedding of \(SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)\) into the UBT framework.
- **Electromagnetism** in curved space, including standing modulated EM field configurations.
- **Quantum electrodynamics (QED)** and **quantum chromodynamics (QCD)** reformulated in UBT variables.
- **Dark sector physics**: unified treatment of dark matter and dark energy via padic extensions.
- **Psychons**: quantum excitations of consciousness within the complex-time phase space.
- **Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)**: geometric and physical conditions for time-travel solutions.
- **Experimental concepts**: Theta Resonator for detecting persistent consciousness fields.
- **Complex Consciousness Theory (CCT)**: simplified, application-oriented formulation for modeling consciousness and cognitive phase transitions.

### Recent Improvements (November 2025)
**Major improvements made to scientific integrity and presentation:**
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive disclaimers to all LaTeX documents
- ‚úÖ Clearly marked speculative content (consciousness, fine-structure constant)
- ‚úÖ Removed problematic claims (death/rebirth speculation)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced transparency about theory status and limitations
- ‚úÖ Mathematical core completely preserved

See [UBT Improvements Summary](UBT_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md) for complete details.

### Consciousness Applications (Highly Speculative)
- **CCT Main Document**: `complex_consciousness/ctc_2.0_main.tex`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Consciousness-related content should be read with the understanding that these are philosophical hypotheses requiring extensive validation, not established science. See [Consciousness Ethics Guidelines](CONSCIOUSNESS_CLAIMS_ETHICS.md).

## üìú Origin & Development

The **Unified Biquaternion Theory** was developed first as a general physical framework.  
During its formulation, a parallel line of work led to the **Complex Consciousness Theory**, which applies UBT principles in a simplified mathematical form to model consciousness as a physical phenomenon.  
This repository contains both the full UBT documents and the CCT application, along with appendices and experimental proposals.
