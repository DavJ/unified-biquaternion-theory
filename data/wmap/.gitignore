# WMAP Raw Data Files
#
# DO NOT commit large data files to the repository.
# Only commit manifest JSON files for provenance tracking.

# Raw data directory - exclude all contents except manifests
raw/*

# But allow the raw directory itself to exist
!raw/.gitkeep

# Allow manifest directory
!manifests/
!manifests/*.json

# Exclude temporary/extracted files
*.fits
*.dat
*.txt
*.csv
*.tar.gz

# But keep any pre-registered manifests
!manifests/*.json
