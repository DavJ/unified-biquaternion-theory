**Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Implemented by:** GitHub Copilot (automated implementation)

## Summary

Starting from version **v0.4**, the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) is released under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)**.

This change protects the integrity of the theoretical work during ongoing academic development by:
- Preventing commercial exploitation of the research
- Preventing unauthorized derivative works

## License Text Template

All updated files now include the following license statement:

```
© 2025 Ing. David Jaroš — CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives

License History: Earlier drafts (up to v0.3) were released under CC BY 4.0. 
From v0.4 onward, all material is released under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 to protect 
the integrity of the theoretical work during ongoing academic development.
```

## What This Means

### You CAN:
- ✅ Share and redistribute the work in any medium or format
- ✅ Use the work for academic research and education
- ✅ Cite and reference the work in publications
- ✅ Access earlier versions (≤ v0.3) under CC BY 4.0 terms

### You CANNOT:
- ❌ Use the work for commercial purposes
- ❌ Create derivative works or modifications
- ❌ Distribute modified versions

- ✔️ Indicate if changes were made (for v0.3 or earlier)

## Why This Change?

The transition to CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 is necessary to:

1. **Protect Academic Integrity**: Ensure the theoretical framework maintains its coherence during active development
2. **Prevent Premature Commercialization**: Allow proper peer review and validation before commercial applications
3. **Maintain Attribution**: Ensure proper credit for original research
4. **Enable Collaboration**: Continue to allow free academic and educational use

## Historical Releases

All versions tagged v0.3 and earlier remain available under the original CC BY 4.0 license. This change does not retroactively affect those releases.

## Future Versions

All future versions of UBT will be released under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 unless explicitly stated otherwise.
