# UBT Compare Scripts

This directory is a scaffold for comparison scripts.

Planned scripts:
- `compare_invariants.py` — compute and compare shared invariants across both formulations
- `compare_cmb_fingerprint.py` — run CMB fingerprint pipeline on both and diff results
- `compare_alpha.py` — compare fine-structure-constant extraction

To be populated as the two formulations mature.
